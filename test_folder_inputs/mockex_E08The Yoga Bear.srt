1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:04,070
ALL RIGHT, PERISCOPE DOWN.

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:06,405
(grunts) ALL RIGHT.

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,108
THERE WE GO.
AND PERISCOPE UP!

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,144
UP!

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,814
EH, THIS ONE'S
A LITTLE TIGHT.

6
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:17,082
HEY, GIVE ME SOME TORQUE.

7
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:19,451
OKAY.

8
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:19,451
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S RIGHTY-TIGHTY.

9
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:22,254
I WANT TO GO LEFTY-LOOSEY.

10
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:22,254
OH, SORRY.

11
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,757
(Jim) I GOT IT.

12
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,458
(Andy grunts)

13
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,795
AH. I WAS JUST WONDERING
HOW MANY MEN IT TAKES

14
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:30,329
TO CHANGE A LIGHTBULB.

15
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,731
OH. AAH.

16
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,335
JIM, I-I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS 85 TIMES.

17
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:39,605
I DON'T THINK
MY BACK CAN TAKE IT.

18
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:43,442
(crunch)

19
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:46,813
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
MY BACK JUST POPPED.

20
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,780
JUST RELAX.
YOU SAT ON A LIGHTBULB.

21
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,750
OH. (chuckles)

22
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:54,353
OH, MY GOD!
I JUST SAT ON A LIGHTBULB!

23
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:57,156
WELL, CHERYL, LOOK AT YOU.

24
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:00,393
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
ALL AERODYNAMIC AND SEXY?

25
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:03,795
JIM, YOU ASK ME THAT
EVERY TIME I GO TO YOGA.

26
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,498
YOGA?

27
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,498
YEAH.

28
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:08,401
OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE GOING TO YOGA AGAIN?

29
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,337
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME
THIS WEEK.

30
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,337
WHAT CAN I SAY? I LIKE IT.

31
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,340
HOW CAN YOU LIKE YOGA?
IT'S SO CREEPY.

32
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,340
OH, IT IS NOT.

33
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:18,210
SURE, IT IS. IT'S CONTORTIONISTS
WITH WEIRD MUSIC.

34
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:18,210
NO.

35
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:22,481
IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS,
COBRAS COMIN' OUT OF BASKETS.

36
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,885
UH, GUYS, I CAN'T FIND
THE LIGHTBULB.

37
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:30,656
CHERYL, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO GO SO OFTEN?

38
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:35,327
DANIEL SAYS THREE TIMES A WEEK
IS THE OPTIMAL AMOUNT OF STUDY.

39
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,197
OKAY, ARE YOU CONFUSED
BY THE NAME DANIEL

40
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,667
OR THE WORD "OPTIMAL"?

41
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,667
I KNOW WHAT "OPTIMAL" MEANS.

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,903
USE IT IN A SENTENCE.

43
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,773
OPTIMAL--THE OPTIMAL AMOUNT OF
CHILDREN IN A FAMILY IS THREE.

44
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,843
YOU STUCK ME WITH FIVE.

45
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,778
OPTIMAL.

46
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:57,150
LOOK, HONEY,
YOGA IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

47
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,286
DANIEL THINKS I'M READY TO TAKE
MY PRACTICE TO A DEEPER LEVEL.

48
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,655
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

49
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:06,159
I WILL ACQUIESCE
DUE TO YOUR INTRACTABILITY.

50
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:08,793
I KNEW THAT WORD-A-DAY CALENDAR
WAS A MISTAKE.

51
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,795
MMM.

52
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,795
MWAH.

53
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,199
OH, THANK GOD. FOUND IT.

54
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,401
ANDY, I DON'T GET
THIS YOGA THING AT ALL.

55
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:18,804
I MEAN, COME ON,
WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN,

56
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,740
"TAKE MY PRACTICE
TO A DEEPER LEVEL"?

57
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,808
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT SOUNDS
LIKE THIS DANIEL

58
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:26,279
WANTS TO TAKE SOMETHING ELSE
TO A DEEPER LEVEL.

59
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,648
PLEASE, I'M NOT GONNA BE
JEALOUS OF SOME SKINNY GUY

60
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,250
WHO TALKS IN A FUNNY ACCENT
WEARIN' DIAPERS.

61
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:34,920
JIM, SHE'S NOT STUDYING
WITH GANDHI.

62
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,890
ALL THESE YOGA GUYS
ARE ALL CUT AND BUFF NOW.

63
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:41,794
HUH?

64
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:41,794
AND THERE'S A LOT OF TOUCHING
AND REPOSITIONING OF POSES.

65
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:45,798
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

66
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:45,798
I'VE OBSERVED
A LOT OF YOGA CLASSES.

67
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,800
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING THROUGH MY BINOCULARS,

68
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,804
BUT IT LOOKS<i> VERY</i> SENSUAL.

69
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,271
(grunts)

70
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,474
ALL RIGHT, PERISCOPE DOWN.

71
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,877
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

72
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:59,878
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

73
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:02,848
SO WHAT IF SHE'S SEEING THIS
DANIEL THREE TIMES A WEEK

74
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,585
FOR SIX WEEKS... (grunts)

75
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:08,620
WEARING NOTHING
BUT SKINTIGHT CLOTHES...

76
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,590
(grunts)

77
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:12,457
GETTIN' ALL SWEATY

78
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,294
AND OUT OF BREATH?

79
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:18,830
RUBY, I WANT YOU TO STAY HOME
AND WATCH THE KIDS.

80
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,968
I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

81
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,968
WAIT. BUT I HAVE TO GO MEET
MY MATH TUTOR AT THE LIBRARY.

82
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,971
WHAT'S 12 TIMES 12?

83
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,671
112?

84
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,308
CLOSE ENOUGH.

85
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:32,344

AND DOWN DOG.

104
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,862
AND BACK
INTO UP DOG.

105
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,564
(groans)

106
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:28,000
HOW MUCH LONGER?

107
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,903
I'M WAITING TO SEE
IF HE GETS TO HORNDOG.

108
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,908
FEEL THE ENERGY FLOW,
CHERYL.

109
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:40,079
OH...
OH, THAT DOES FEEL BETTER.

110
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,683
WHAT'S HE TOUCHING?

111
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,683
I CAN'T SEE.
I CAN'T SEE HIS HANDS.

112
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,550
AND INTO DOWN DOG.

113
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,918
(groans)

114
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:49,822
WHAT THE HELL?

115
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:53,759
WHAT ARE YOU,
STANDING IN A CREEK?

116
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,360
I'M SWEATING A LITTLE.

117
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:56,862
(groans)

118
00:04:56,894 --> 00:05:00,565
THAT ALL CAME OUT OF YOU?

119
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:02,634
I THINK I SEE A TROUT.

120
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:03,935
I DON'T THINK

121
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:07,473
I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO RETURN THE YOGA OUTFIT.

122
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,541
(groans)

123
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:12,745
OKAY,
INTO WARRIOR II.

124
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,112
PARDON ME.

125
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,980
OOH.

126
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,751
UH, EXCUSE ME,
EXCUSE ME.

127
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:21,553
DO YOU MIND IF I LIE DOWN
NEXT TO MY WIFE

128
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:26,125
OF 19 YEARS, 5 CHILDREN,
AND 1,000 LIGHTBULBS?

129
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,793
<i> NAMASTE.</i>

130
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,962
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I'M GONNA STAY.

131
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,798
JIM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

132
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,798
YOGA.

133
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,533
YOU KNOW, YOU KEPT TALKING
ABOUT HOW GREAT DANIEL IS.

134
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,836
I JUST WANTED TO
CHECK IT OUT FOR MYSELF.

135
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,639
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ROOM
FOR YOU UP HERE.

136
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,641
OH, CHERYL, IF THERE'S ROOM
IN THE UNIVERSE,

137
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,409
THERE'S ROOM
IN OUR CLASS.

138
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:45,911
RIGHT.

139
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:49,782
I LIKE THAT.
VERY SPIRITUAL.

140
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,920
ALL RIGHT, TOOTS,
SHOVE OVER.

141
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:56,921

146
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,438
HEY, CHERYL,

147
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,441
I JUST BOWLED A 9.

148
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,509
OH!

149
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,176
AAH!

150
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,979
I JUST MADE THE SPARE.

151
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,818
TRY NOT TO EMBARRASS ME.

152
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:29,654
I FIND THAT...
VERY INSULTING.

153
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:31,656
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

154
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,192
LET'S GET

155
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,860
HALF-MOON?

156
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,530
SERIOUSLY?

157
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:40,832
ALL RIGHT, LET ME KNOW

WHAT?

160
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,939
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT MEANS.
STOP IT.

161
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,473
(sighs)

162
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,717
WOW.

163
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,886
WHERE HAVE YOU
STUDIED BEFORE?

164
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,988
NO, THIS IS
MY FIRST CLASS.

165
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,988
YOU'RE OFF

OKAY, I GET IT.
SARCASM.

167
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:07,992

00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,163
OKAY,<i> THAT'S</i> SARCASM.

SARCASM?

00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,237
ALL RIGHT,

173
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,938
OKAY.

00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,907
WHOO, EASY THERE,

REALLY GOOD.

179
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,250
YEAH, I'M RELEASING
YOUR CHAKRAS.

180
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:34,687
FEEL THE ENERGY FLOW.

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,689
I FEEL THAT.
I REALLY DO.

182
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:39,824
HEY, CHERYL,
I GOT CHAKRAS.

183
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:39,824
YEAH.

184
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,694
(out of breath)
HEY, DANIEL.

185
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,030
ANY CHANCE YOU GOT
A PAIR OF SWIM GOGGLES?

186
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:48,166
I'M GETTING A LITTLE...
WATER IN THE EYE.

187
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,701
(clears throat)

188
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,069
(sighs)

189
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,507
(Jim) OH, CHERYL...

190
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,909
I FEEL GREAT.

191
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,877
OH! I FEEL GREAT, TOO.

192
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,982
WE FEEL GREAT TOGETHER.
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?

193
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,550
WELL...

194
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,220
OH, BESIDES THAT.

195
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:13,192
NEVER.

196
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:16,228
YOU KNOW, I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA HATE YOGA.

197
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,930
HATE YOGA? JEEZ.

198
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,232
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

199
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:23,568
WELL, YESTERDAY YOU CALLED IT
"TWISTER IN DIAPERS."

200
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,870
AND THEN, THIS MORNING,
YOU SAID IT WAS CREEPY.

201
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,874
OH, CHERYL, COME ON,
I BLAME YOU FOR THAT.

202
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,874
WHAT?

203
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:32,711
YOU TOLD ME IT WAS ALL,
LIKE, COBRAS AND BASKETS.

204
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:34,713
YOU SAID THAT.

205
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:37,982
I DON'T THINK SO.

206
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,952
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF DANIEL, HUH?

207
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,952
OH, DANIEL,
HE IS SO COOL.

208
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:43,322
HOW EVOLVED IS THAT GUY?
HIS MIND IS SO CENTERED.

209
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:46,225
YOU--YOU KNOW WHAT
HE SAID TO ME AFTER CLASS?

210
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:49,061
HE SAID HE COULD TAKE
MY PRACTICE TO A DEEPER LEVEL.

211
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,063
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

212
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,063
YEAH.

213
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,764
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

214
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,167
WE FOUND SOMETHING
WE WANT TO DO TOGETHER.

215
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,167
YEAH.

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,802
YOU KNOW, DANIEL LEADS
YOGA RETREATS EVERY YEAR.

217
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,337
WELL, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

218
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,906
(gasps) EVERYBODY SLEEPS
IN A YURT.

219
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,777
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT--THAT GETS GREAT MILEAGE.

220
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,211
NO. NO, HONEY...

221
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,016
A YURT
IS A MONGOLIAN HUT.

222
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:12,884
OKAY, OKAY,
TELL ME, TELL ME,

223
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,887
WHEN IS THE NEXT CLASS?

224
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,055
TUESDAY. I CAN'T GO.
THE KIDS' CHECKUPS.

225
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,924
OH...

226
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:21,259
TOO BAD.

227
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:27,932
WHAT TIME TUESDAY?

228
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,969
3:00, BUT...

229
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,971
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO
BY YOURSELF, ARE YOU?

230
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:36,875
THIS IS OUR TOGETHER THING,
RIGHT?

231
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,877
PLEASE.

232
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:41,980
I WOULD NEVER DO...

233
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,249
A TOGETHER THING...

234
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:45,951
WITHOUT YOU.

235
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,786
AW.

236
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,921
<i> NAMASTE.</i>

237
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,323
<i>NAMASTE.</i>

238
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:52,957
<i> NAMASTE.</i>

239
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,326
MMM...

240
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,362
HI, DANIEL.

241
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:59,731
HI, JIM.
WHERE'S CHERYL?

242
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:01,165
OH, CHERYL?

243
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:03,901
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
SICK KIDS OR SOMETHING.

244
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,870
(mouths words)

245
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:07,840
(inhales deeply)

246
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,943
CAN I LEAD THE "OM"?

247
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,943
IF YOU'D LIKE.

248
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,111
OM...

249
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,913
OM...

250
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,913
OM...

251
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,915
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE.
DEEP IN...

252
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:18,917
(inhales deeply) OM...

253
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,220
OM...

254
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,220
OM...

255
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,355
ONE LAST ONE,
PLEASE, JIM.

256
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,889
(inhales deeply)

257
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,393
OM...

258
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,102
OH, HEY, RUBE,

259
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:40,139
I NEED YOU TO WATCH YOUR
BROTHER, SISTER AND THE BABIES.

260
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,108
YOUR DAD AND I
ARE TAKING A YOGA CLASS.

261
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,076
WHAT? THAT'S THREE TIMES
THIS WEEK.

262
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,079
AND I KNOW THAT "YOGA"
MEANS YOU TWO

263
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,914
ARE SNEAKING OFF SOMEPLACE
TO HOOK UP.

264
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:53,351
OH, NO. NO, WE'RE NOT.
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO YOGA.

265
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:56,355
IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL
THAT YOUR DAD AND I DO TOGETHER.

266
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,357
WE MAY EVEN GO
ON A RETREAT.

267
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,958
OKAY, BUT IF YOU TWO
MAKE ANOTHER BABY,

268
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,862
I'M NOT TAKING CARE
OF IT.

269
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:07,799
CHERYL, CHERYL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK THE LADIES WILL DO

270
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,802
WHEN THEY SEE
MY NEW SOUL PATCH?

271
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,171
IT'S JUST LIKE DANIEL'S.

272
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:14,105
I SEE SOME DIRT THERE.

273
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,108
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO LOOK LIKE DANIEL?

274
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,810
WELL, HE THINKS
IF HE LOOKS LIKE DANIEL,

275
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,814
HE'LL GET THE GIRLS
LIKE DANIEL.

276
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,814
OH.

277
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,115
WHEN THE PONYTAIL COMES IN,
EVERYONE WILL SAY,

278
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,251
"HEY, WHY IS DANIEL TRYING
TO LOOK LIKE ANDY?"

279
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:30,154
WHEN YOUR PONYTAIL COMES IN,
THEY'LL ALL BE SAYING,

280
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:32,157
"HEY, WHO'S THE SWEATY GIRL?"

281
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,793
SHUT UP!

282
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,961
<i> NAMASTE.</i>

283
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:42,266
SO ARE YOU READY
FOR SOME DANIEL TONIGHT?

284
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,402
YES, I CERTAINLY AM.

285
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:46,772
I AM SO GLAD
YOU DID THE LAUNDRY

286
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:50,208
BECAUSE I NEED
MY SPECIAL YOGA SHORTS.

287
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:50,208
OH, HONEY, I WASHED 'EM
YESTERDAY.

288
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,943
THEY'RE IN YOUR DRAWER.

289
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:53,978
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.

290
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:58,149
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE.

291
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:02,820
WAIT A MINUTE, JIM.

292
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:03,922
MM-HMM.

293
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,924
THESE ARE YOUR YOGA SHORTS.

294
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,393
WHAT ARE THEY DOING
IN THE DIRTY LAUNDRY?

295
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,829
OH, THESE ARE KYLE'S.

296
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:13,998
THESE ARE KYLE'S?

297
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:18,403
YEAH, HE'S BEEN
EATING A LOT LATELY.

298
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,939
YOU WENT TO DANIEL'S CLASS
WITHOUT ME.

299
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:24,009
NO, BABY, NO, NO.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

300
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,944
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

301
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,947
I JUST WENT ONCE.

302
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,947
OH, NO.

303
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,949
TWICE.

304
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,949
(gasps)

305
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,117
JIM, THAT--THAT'S
OUR TOGETHER THING.

306
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,887
FIVE TIMES THIS WEEK.

307
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,887
OH, NO.

308
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,924
TWO TIMES ON MONDAY,
PLUS A PRIVATE LESSON.

309
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,924
I CAN'T BELIEVE--

310
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:42,260
<i> AND</i> WE WENT FOR SOME, UH,
CHAI TEA AND SOME WHEATGRASS.

311
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,962
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THAT TO ME.

312
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,264
HOW COULD YOU?

313
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,932
OKAY, CHERYL,
CHERYL, CHERYL.

314
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,835
I'M SENSING
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

315
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:52,504
LISTEN, BREATHE WITH ME.

316
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,907
(inhales deeply)

317
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,408
(exhales deeply)

318
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,410
(inhales deeply)

319
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:01,078
(exhales deeply)

320
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:01,078
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

321
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,914
I'M EXHALING
THE NEGATIVE ENERGY

322
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:07,019
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
FILLING THE ROOM WITH.

323
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,986
<i>I</i> FILLED THE ROOM WITH?

324
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,490
YES, DANIEL SAYS
THIS IS THE BEST WAY

325
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:14,158
TO STAY CALM
DURING TIMES OF STRESS.

326
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,260
(exhales deeply)

327
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,260
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

328
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,263
YOU DON'T QUOTE DANIEL
TO ME.

329
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:20,331
FROM NOW ON,
DANIEL IS<i> MY</i> YOGA TEACHER.

330
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:23,601
I THOUGHT WE COULD SHARE HIM,
BUT I WAS WRONG.

331
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:26,938
I WANT HIM ALL TO MYSELF.

332
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:26,938
OH, CHERYL, YOU SADDEN ME.

333
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,509
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT
LIKE THE SWAN ON THE WATER,

334
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,543
YOU CAN VISIT THE SKY...

335
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,480
BUT YOU CANNOT POSSESS IT?

336
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,048
WHAT?

337
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:40,085
DANIEL'S MINE, BLONDIE!
BEAT IT!

338
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:42,955
BEAT IT!

339
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:42,955
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

340
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,958
(both inhaling
and exhaling)

341
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,003
OH, I'M SORRY.

342
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,042
JIM?

343
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,610
OH.

344
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,512
HELLO, CHERYL.

345
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,881
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
DANIEL WAS MINE.

346
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:14,086
AND I THOUGHT YOU HEARD ME
WHEN I SAID... (blows raspberry)

347
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,088
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
LET'S START CLASS

348
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,057
WITH A LITTLE DEEP BREATHING
IN THE CHILD'S POSE.

349
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,461
OOH, CHILD'S POSE--
SHOULD BE EASY FOR YOU.

350
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,931
MASTER...

351
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,500
I PUT IN
THE RELAXATION CD.

352
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,269
HERE IS YOUR CHAI TEA.

353
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,471
AND ONE OF YOUR PUPILS,
VANESSA,

354
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,307
IS HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE
IN THE CORNER.

355
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,408
MAY I ADJUST HER?

356
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,644
DO NOT TOUCH HER.

357
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,313
THEN WHY AM I WEARING
THE ROBE?

358
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,649
I DON'T KNOW.
NO ONE WEARS A ROBE.

359
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,619
AND YOU DON'T WORK HERE.

360
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:50,622
(clears throat) IT IS MY HONOR
TO SIMPLY SERVE.

361
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:54,125
ALSO, I ORDERED YOU
A PATTY MELT FOR LUNCH.

362
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,660
I DON'T EAT MEAT.

363
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:59,197
THEN IT WILL BE MY HONOR
TO EAT IT FOR YOU.

364
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,634
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
LET'S COME TO OUR FEET

365
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,637
AND GET
TO THE TREE POSE.

366
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,306
TREE POSE.

367
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,008
RELAX YOUR HIPS.

368
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,543
I SENSE SOME TENSION.

369
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,079
WELL, NO BIG SURPRISE...

370
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:15,947
WITH HER HERE.

371
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,283
MY HIPS AREN'T TENSE,
ARE THEY, DANIEL?

372
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:22,321
NO, CHERYL, BUT REMEMBER,
WE DO YOGA FOR OUR SOUL,

373
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,956
NOT OUR EGO.

374
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:24,990
YEAH.

375
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,559
I'D RATHER HAVE TENSE HIPS
THAN A BIG, FAT EGO.

376
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:33,397
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
YOU HAVE BOTH.

377
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,667
OW! OW!

378
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,735
OH, LOOK,

379
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:39,605
CHERYL'S TREE HAS FALLEN.

380
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,573
MM-HMM.

381
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:45,110
YOU, UH, LOOK MUCH BETTER
CLOSE UP

382
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,947
THAN YOU DO
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

383
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,586
I'M SENSING A LOT OF...

384
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,190
NEGATIVE ENERGY
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU TODAY.

385
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:01,258
FRANKLY, IT'S STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF.

386
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:04,997
HE RUINS EVERYTHING.

387
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:04,997
UH, LOOK, WH-WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CHOOSE, DANIEL,

388
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,564
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US?

389
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,266
YEAH.

390
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,266
I CAN'T DO THAT.

391
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,235
(Cheryl) SOMEBODY HAS
TO DECIDE SOMETHING.

392
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,235
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS OUTSIDE?

393
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:14,005
POSE-OFF!

394
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:14,005
HA! WINNER GETS DANIEL!

395
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,441
HEY, EVERYBODY,
THERE'S GONNA BE A POSE-OFF!

396
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:17,642
NO! NO. NO POSE-OFF.

397
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:20,745
I CAN HANDLE THIS,
DANIEL.

398
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:20,745
HE DOESN'T EVEN
WORK HERE.

399
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,447
JUST DRINK YOUR CHAI TEA.

400
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,749
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
PUSH IT BACK!

401
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,450
SAFETY FIRST, PLEASE!

402
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:27,284
SET THE MATS UP CORRECTLY.

403
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,788
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION
RULES APPLY.

404
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,790
JIM WILL START.

405
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:34,192
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

406
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,460
POSE IT!

407
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:39,598
(cheering)

408
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,067
CHAIR POSE!

409
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,468
EASY. GO!

410
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,137
(woman) ALL RIGHT,
GO, CHERYL!

411
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,774
SHOULDERSTAND!

412
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,774
SHOULDERSTAND. EASY.

413
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,274
UH-OH, UH-OH.

414
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:52,510
WHOA. YES?

415
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:55,813
WHOO!

416
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:55,813
BEAUTIFUL! GO!

417
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,316
(cheering)

418
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,786
GO, CHERYL!

419
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,786
ALL RIGHT, CHERYL!

420
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,286
HAPPY BABY!

421
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,824
(giggling)

422
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,824
(blowing raspberries)

423
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:07,392
ADORABLE.

424
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,360
NEXT!

425
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,461
WHEEL!

426
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:12,196
(gasps)

427
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,798
HA!

428
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,102
(imitates Southern accent)
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I JUST SAW!

429
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:19,538
(normal voice) NEXT!

430
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:19,538
(cheering)

431
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,138
CROW!

432
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,642
OH.

433
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:29,180
(gasps)

434
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:30,848
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN MIRACLES?

435
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,085
NEXT!

436
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,085
(cheering)

437
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,653
OH, HO-HO!

438
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,353
HEADSTAND.

439
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:39,390
OOH.

440
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:39,390
(students murmuring)

441
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:42,727
(gasps)

442
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,528
YES? (gasps)

443
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,163
OH!

444
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,163
(groaning)

445
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,766
CHERYL WINS! CHERYL WINS!

446
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,669
(cheering and whistling)

447
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,669
IT'S A MADHOUSE!

448
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:54,239
TIME-OUT, TIME-OUT.

449
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,173
HA! IN YOUR FACE!

450
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,642
ALL RIGHT!

451
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,642
DANIEL'S MINE!

452
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,144
(singsong voice) DANIEL'S MINE!

453
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:01,612
INNER PEACE AND ETERNAL LIGHT
ARE MINE!

454
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:04,883
ARE MINE! ARE MINE!
ARE MINE! HA!

455
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:04,883
ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN, YOU WIN,
YOU WIN, YOU WIN,

456
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,652
YOU WIN, YOU WIN!

457
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,652
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
THE BOTH OF YOU,

458
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:09,319
JUST GET OUT OF HERE!

459
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:09,319
WHAT?

460
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:13,158
YOU HEARD ME.
YOU'RE BOTH NUTS.

461
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:13,158
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE SHOULD BE ACCEPTING

462
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,660
OF ALL PEOPLE.

463
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,660
YES, EVERYONE!
EXCEPT YOU.

464
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,896
NOW GET OUT OF HERE,
AND TAKE RAJIV WITH YOU.

465
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,896
WHO?

466
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,231
RAJIV!

467
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,700
OH, UH...

468
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:24,368
CAN YOU, UH,
GIVE ME A MINUTE, MASTER?

469
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:25,769
I'M THIS CLOSE

470
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:28,807
TO A<i> TRIKONASANA </i>
WITH THESE TWO, HUH?

471
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,113
(scoffs)

472
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,488
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

473
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,656
CHERYL,
IT IS LIKE THE EGRET

474
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,894
THAT BUILDS A NEST
IN THE TALL GRASS--

475
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,894
REALLY, JIM,
ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?

476
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,395
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

477
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,398
WE HAVE LOOKED
OUR WHOLE MARRIAGE

478
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,901
FOR SOMETHING
WE COULD DO TOGETHER.

479
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,670
WE--WE--WE FINALLY FIND IT,
AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES,

480
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,405
WE WRECKED IT--
WRECKED IT!

481
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,405
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

482
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,375
TO BE FAIR,
I DIDN'T WRECK IT.

483
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,943
I HOGGED IT.<i>
YOU</i> WRECKED IT.

484
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,943
(sighs) BUT WHY?

485
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:09,214
WHEN THIS WHOLE THING STARTED,
YOGA WAS JUST THIS SPECIAL THING

486
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,449
THAT WAS JUST FOR ME.

487
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,449
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY
I WANTED IT.

488
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,818
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

489
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,818
SURE IT MAKES SENSE,
CHERYL.

490
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:17,322
MY WHOLE LIFE,
I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO FIGHT

491
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,324
FOR EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.

492
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,825
HONEY... (sighs)

493
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,827
LOOK...
I GREW UP IN A FAMILY

494
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,598
THAT HID TOYS
FROM EACH OTHER...

495
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,798
FOOD...

496
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,802
AND SOMETIMES DAD.

497
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,337
SO, HONEY,
IT REALLY FREAKS ME OUT

498
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:37,942
WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

499
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,645
SO THEN YOU EITHER
TAKE IT FOR YOURSELF

500
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:42,647
OR RUIN IT FOR ME?

501
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,749
WELL,
THERE'S A THIRD OPTION.

502
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:46,984
I RUIN IT FOR EVERYBODY.

503
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:48,620
OH, HONEY. HONEY.

504
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:49,788
WHAT?

505
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,958
THAT IS THE MOST TERRIBLE,
TRAGIC THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

506
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:55,793
AH, IT'S...

507
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,962
IT'S A QUIRK.

508
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,432
NO, HONEY, IT--
IT'S NOT A QUIRK.

509
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:03,968
YOU'RE A DAMAGED,
DEEPLY SCARRED PERSON.

510
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:06,303
I KNOW.

511
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,939
QUIRKY.

512
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:10,875
SO... AS LONG
AS WE'RE MARRIED,

513
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:13,877
I CAN NEVER HAVE ANYTHING
THAT'S JUST FOR ME?

514
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,880
YOU CAN HAVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT...

515
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:18,883
AS LONG AS I HATE IT
AND KNOW I DON'T WANT IT.

516
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:20,083
OKAY, UM...

517
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:23,387
IT'S HEALTHY FOR OUR MARRIAGE
TO HAVE SEPARATE INTERESTS,

518
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,856
AND WE'RE NOT AFRAID
TO GIVE EACH OTHER SPACE.

519
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,559
VERY GOOD.

520
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:28,693
HUH.

521
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,630
YOU'VE JUST MADE GREAT ADVICE
OUT OF MY QUIRKINESS.

522
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,632
OH, SWEETHEART,
ANDY'S QUIRKY.

523
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,299
YOU NEED TREATMENT.

524
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,968
(chuckles)

525
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:39,605
HEY, EVERYBODY! HUH!

526
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,840
YOGA RETREAT AT RAJIV'S,

527
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,876
SO GRAB YOUR MATS
AND LET'S<i> CHATURANGA.</i>

528
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,811
HA HA!

529
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,779
OH!

530
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,815
(whispers)
IF EITHER OF THEM ASK,

531
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:53,417
YOU'VE SEEN ME
LEVITATE ONCE.

532
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:56,955
(laughs)

533
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,823
CAN I AT LEAST
STILL DO YOGA?

534
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:02,027
AS LONG AS IT'S
