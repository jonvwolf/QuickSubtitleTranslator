1
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:12,423
Hello? Excuse me?
There's a line, buddy.

2
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:13,584
There's two lines.

3
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:16,062
No, no, there's one line.
We're in it.

4
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:17,898
I'm just getting
a hot dog.

5
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:19,406
We're all getting hot dogs.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,875
What, do you think
there's two lines

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,345
and we're all in this line

8
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,782
and you're the only genius
that got in the other line?

9
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:25,981
You believe this guy?

10
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:30,291
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.

11
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:32,304
Hey, shut up.

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,138
Now I want all the hot dogs,
please.

13
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:35,544
Yeah,
I'm buying all the hot dogs.

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,582
You don't have to do that.

15
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:38,119
No, no, no,
You don't have to do that.

16
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,154
That is ridiculous.

17
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,523
And I'm giving them
to the good people.

18
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:42,723
I'm starving.

00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,065

00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:19,815
The Overly-Confident
Morbidly Obese Woman.

35
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:22,689
This fat suit
smells like corn chips.

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,858
<i>Going again,
please. Thank you.</i>

37
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,200
And this is the set
of "The Girlie Show."

38
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:30,142
It's a real fun ladies'
comedy show for ladies.

39
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,808
Hey, everybody, look.

40
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,513
Here's someone you never
get a chance to meet.

41
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,651
It's the head writer
of "The Girlie Show," Liz Lemon.

42
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,480
"The Girlie Show."

43
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:45,984
Hold on,
I'll connect you.

44
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,215
Hey.
What's up?

45
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,259
Hey, have you looked
at that cat-lady sketch?

46
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:50,591
It's still
seven minutes long.

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,598
Yikes, okay.

48
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:53,102
Oh, and Standards
has a problem

49
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:54,434
with that
Michael Jackson bit.

50
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:55,441
Why?

51
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,172
Apparently,
you can't say he's got a vagina.

52
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,274
Ohh! Fine, I'll just
take the whole thing out.

53
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,117
Hey, you've got to tell
that NBC page

54
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,283
to take it down a notch.

55
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:03,293
Who, Kenneth?

56
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:04,956
He just embarrassed me
in front of a whole tour group.

57
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:07,127
I'll talk to him.
What is this?

58
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,299
Well, you know how I hate it
when people cheat

59
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:10,401
or break rules?

60
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:11,573
Yes, I do.

61
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:13,448
Well, I just spent 150 bucks
on wieners.

62
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:14,614
Attaboy.

63
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,657
Chumley, the beverage situation
around here

64
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:19,963
is reprehensible.

65
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:21,801
Oh, good morning,
sunshine.

66
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,274
Surely,
our massive conglomerate

67
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,145
parent company could spring
for a samovar of coffee.

68
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:30,123
Yeah, or, like,
a big coffee dispenser.

69
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,891
That's what a samovar is.

70
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:35,459
Are there other black nerds,
or is it just you and Urkel?

71
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:38,306
Uh, Cerie, do you want to
go get some coffee?

72
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,441
No, thank you.

73
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,954
No?

74
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,822
Hey, Josh, I need to change
your Michael Jackson thing.

75
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,128
Didn't you tell me
you had a Jay Leno impression?

76
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:48,671
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
check it out.

77
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:50,606
So, President Bush

78
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,112
is in the news again.

79
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:54,549
<i>No, Jay Leno.</i>

80
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:56,022
The host
of "The Tonight Show."

81
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,560
That's what I was doing.

82
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,222
So, my wife Mavis and I

83
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,393
like to go shopping
for old cars, you know?

84
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,566
No, no, like Jay Leno.

85
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,011
Like,
"Hey, here are the headlines."

86
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:07,345
Have you ever noticed

87
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,183
when you eat
a lot of cheese...

88
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:11,260
How is that different
from what I was doing?

89
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,958
And I don't think you need to
introduce the writers

90
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,299
to the tour group.

91
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:16,533
I agree.

92
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,042
I thought
they would find it interesting,

93
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:19,205
but they really did not.

94
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,750
Well, Kenneth,
just respect their privacy.

95
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:23,448
I promise
I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger.

96
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,527
I'm sure you will.

97
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,187
I just...

98
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,029
I just love television
so much.

99
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:29,867
We all do.

100
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,275
Liz, they want you and Pete
on the 50th floor.

101
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:35,717
Who, Gary? All right, tell him
I'll be up in half an hour.

102
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:37,381
No, they said now.

103
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:39,395
If they've got cookies up there,
grab some.

104
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,433
Ooh, and get them to pay
for my samovar.

105
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,505
Of course. I assume
that's what we're meeting about.

106
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,271
What about Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?

107
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:49,146
Hey, aah, ho, Debra.

108
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:50,451
There you go.

109
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,083
My brother's tall!

110
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,824
Right?

111
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,196
Are we in trouble
or something?

112
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:56,862
No way.
Gary loves the show.

113
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,205
Pleased with the ratings.

114
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:02,875
Right, of course.
They love us.

115
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,529
Where's Gary?

116
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:11,731
Gary's dead.

117
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:13,710
I'm Jack Donaghy,

118
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,751
new VP of Development
for NBC-GE-Universal-Kmart.

119
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,188
We own Kmart now?

120
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:19,192
No.

121
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:21,662
So, why are you dressed
like we do?

122
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,676
I'm surprised you're renovating.
This is such a nice office.

123
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,183
It's a great office,
but sometimes, you have to

124
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,053
change things
that are perfectly good

125
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:34,220
just to make them your own.

126
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,961
Please.

127
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:39,007
Uh, I'll call her back.

128
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,977
Is she at
the White House line? Great.

129
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:44,449
Tell them I need
a 4:00 A. M. tee-off time.

130
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:48,222
Uh, 5 inches,
but it's thick.

131
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:53,263
Are you familiar
with the GE trivection oven?

132
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,778
I don't cook very much.

133
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:56,942
Sure. I got you.

134
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:00,583
New York third-wave feminist,
college-educated,

135
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,256
single and pretending to be
happy about it,

136
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,733
overscheduled, undersexed.

137
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:04,862
You buy any magazine

138
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:07,102
that says "healthy body image"
on the cover.

139
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:12,014
And every two years,
you take up knitting for...

140
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,023
a week.

141
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:14,959
That is dead-on!

142
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,693
What, are you gonna
guess my weight now?

143
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,327
You don't want me
to do that.

144
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,137
That knitting thing is uncanny.
How do you do that?

145
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:22,806
Market research, my friend.

146
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,977
Years and years
of market research

147
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,220
which led to my greatest
triumph... the trivection oven.

148
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:32,667
Oh. My wife
wants one of those.

149
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:34,175
Can we get Pete an oven,
please?

150
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,746
The GE trivection oven

151
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,283
cooks perfect food
five times faster

152
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:38,752
than a conventional oven

153
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:40,017
because it uses
three kinds of heat...

154
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,459
thermal technology
for consistent temperature,

155
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,500
GE precise
air-convection technology

156
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:46,037
for optimal
air circulation,

157
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:49,703
and microwave technology
for incredible speed.

158
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:53,720
With three kinds of heat,
you can cook a turkey...

159
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:56,058
in 22 minutes.

160
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,726
Wow.
That is impressive.

161
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,570
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
That's why they sent me here
to retool your show.

163
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,245
Retool what, now?

164
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:08,417
I'm the new Vice President
of east-coast television

165
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,293
and microwave-oven
programming.

166
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:13,370
That sounds like
you program microwave ovens.

167
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:16,239
I like you.

168
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,216
You have the boldness
of a much-younger woman.

169
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,159
Lee, does my face
look bloated to you?

170
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:29,835
When I played that lady rapist
on "Law & Order,"

171
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,179
guess what the makeup guy
put on under my eyes

172
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:33,687
to take the puffiness out.

173
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,315
Hemorrhoid cream.

174
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:42,541
Miss Maroney, I have
the cat wrangler here for you.

175
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:45,342
Oh, is it
that horrible little... Hi.

176
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:48,513
Hey. Greta Johanssen...
short for Lugreta.

177
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:49,686
Hi. Great
to see you again.

178
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:50,696
You too.

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,529
I'm here to introduce you
to the feline actors

180
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:53,866
you're gonna be
working with tonight.

181
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:55,738
Okay.
This is Poppo.

182
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:56,903
And this here
is Captain Boots.

183
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:57,913
Hello.

184
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,144
Would you describe yourself
as cat-competent?

185
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,225
Oh, yes.
I love cats.

186
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:03,386
I used to have two cats.

187
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,397
But then I moved to this place
with hardwood floors,

188
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:07,094
so we had to
put them down.

189
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:10,611
I'm joking.

190
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:13,275
We've done several focus groups
on the show,

191
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,686
and what I've gleaned...

192
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,625
the blond,
big-eyed girl is popular

193
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:19,859
with women and older gays.

194
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,233
Jenna.
That's my friend Jenna.

195
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,901
And the kid with the funny hair
is liked by women,

196
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:28,178
but you're missing men
between 18 and 49.

197
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,316
I'm not missing them.
They're just not there.

198
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,227
I think I can fix that.

199
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:35,429
So, your job is you take things
that are already working,

200
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:36,510
and you fix them.

201
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,636
That's a great job.

202
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,217
Why don't we, uh...

203
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,414
You're missing
that third kind of heat.

204
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,721
I want you to think
about Tracy Jordan.

205
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,356
Okay, the black guy?

206
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,527
The black movie star.

207
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,038
I flew with him on a private jet
to the Super Bowl recently,

208
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,544
and I found him
very entertaining.

209
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:55,209
Isn't he, um... crazy?

210
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:57,792
Tracy's had his problems
in the last few years.

211
00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,990
I am a Jedi!

212
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:02,002
I am a Jedi!

213
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,439
I am a Jedi!

214
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:05,809
The important thing
to remember is

215
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,942
he was never charged
with a crime.

216
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,990
It's not illegal to fall asleep
on your neighbor's roof.

217
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:11,789
Nor should it be.

218
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:14,890
Tracy Jordan
is the third heat.

219
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:17,065
I don't know where we're gonna
find room in the budget

220
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:18,475
for a guy
like Tracy Jordan.

221
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,105
I think I do.

222
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,160
What are you doing?

223
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,697
Sometimes,
when I have these stress dreams,

224
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:30,532
if I go to sleep in the dream,
I come out of it.

225
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,338
"This is not a dream."

226
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:35,542
Tracy Jordan
is in New York today, Liz.

227
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:37,521
I'd like you
to have lunch with him.

228
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,561
We have a show tonight,
Mr. Donaghy.

229
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,223
I don't know
if your research covered this,

230
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:43,897
but we do a dress rehearsal
and then a live show.

231
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,240
That's tonight.
This is lunch.

232
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,249
If it's not a good fit,
I'll drop the whole thing.

233
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:51,619
If I meet with Tracy Jordan
and we mutually agree

234
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:55,187
that this is the worst idea
ever, you'll back off?

235
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:56,737
I'm known
for being reasonable.

236
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:01,515
Okay.

237
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:02,847
Alfredo, 2:00 P. M.

238
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,514
I'm not dressed
for that.

239
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:07,060
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King?

240
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:10,466
Pete,
hang back for me.

241
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:11,974
Yeah, you bet.

242
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,287
<i>Y'all, please set yourselves
for "Dr. Ridiculous."</i>

243
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,363
Hey.

244
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:21,762
What happened
to your head?

245
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:22,926
The sky is falling.

246
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,938
Do you have a pair
of dress pants or a skirt

247
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:27,204
or something
I could borrow?

248
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:28,543
Thank you, Lee.

249
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,550
Whatever.

250
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:30,986
Hey, you know
in that cat-lady sketch,

251
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,320
do I have to hold
a real cat?

252
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:34,521
Cat-lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.

253
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,693
Oh, good.

254
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,238
Who's that?

255
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:40,242
That is
the new network dude.

256
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,247
Mmm, yummers.

257
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:44,752
He reminds me of Scotty
on "General Hospital."

258
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:48,295
No, ew, Jenna, do not like
that man. That is a bad man.

259
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,460
God, you have a gift.

260
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:52,369
Laura Bush
is your size.

261
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:02,930
Excuse me. Hi.
What are you doing down here?

262
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,027
I'm known
for being hands-on.

263
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:06,039
Clearly.

264
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:08,134
That's how you should dress
for work, by the way.

265
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:11,581
Yeah, if I was president
of the Philippines.

266
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,789
Now, Afghanistan
is a different situation.

267
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,129
I'll have an apple juice.

268
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,675
We don't
have apple juice, sir.

269
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,943
Then I'll take
a vodka and tonic.

270
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,852
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.

271
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,486
I know who you are.

272
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:35,665
I thought there was a strict
dress code at this place.

273
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,375
I do recommend
the pumpkin ravioli.

274
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:40,047
They're very subtle.

275
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:43,824
So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy
wanted me to talk to you

276
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,200
about joining the cast
of our show,

277
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:47,741
and I don't know
how you feel about that...

278
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,576
Let me ask you a question,
everybody at this table.

279
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:53,211
Did he just say
the word "pumpkin" to me?

280
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:55,590
Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli.

281
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:56,596
Yo!

282
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,192
I'm buggin'. I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.

283
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,607
I can't eat here.

284
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:04,045
I got to go someplace where
they make food that I like.

285
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,688
Lemon, let's go.

286
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,355
I will not work
with Tracy Jordan.

287
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,365
It's just a rumor.

288
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,869
Have you seen
any of his movies?

289
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,874
The guy's sensibility
is just cretinous.

290
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:16,207
I saw the one
where he plays,

291
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:17,714
like,
five different characters.

292
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:19,480
Yeah,
"Black Cop, White Cop."

293
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,921
No.

294
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:21,925
"Who Dat Ninja"?

295
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,556
No, he... he had to pretend
to be this old lady.

296
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:28,231
Ooh, ooh, goodness gracious!

297
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,403
You hooligans
better watch out!

298
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:33,144
'Cause this
honky grandma be trippin'!

299
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:35,656
Oh, yeah,
that movie was hilarious.

300
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:38,698
I saw it,
like, five times.

301
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:41,700
Where's the love?

302
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,410
Right on. Hey,
let me get two half a chickens

303
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:47,820
and some pecan waffles.

304
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,156
Nothing for me.

305
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,825
I had, like,
four hot dogs this morning.

306
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,633
Eat, Lemon, eat.

307
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:56,334
I hate skinny women.

308
00:11:56,447 --> 00:12:00,008
Hey, Lana, 10 beers.

309
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:02,852
So, Tracy,
we should talk about the show.

310
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:05,192
I ain't doing it unless
I can get to do it my way.

311
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:08,396
You know, I want it to be raw,
HBO-style content.

312
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,101
Well, it's not HBO.
It's TV.

313
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:12,114
And I don't think
that it's a good fit.

314
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,278
'Cause I'm gonna
drop truth bombs.

315
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:15,619
You know
how pissed off I was

316
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,627
<i>when U S Weekly
said that I was on crack?</i>

317
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,462
That's racist.
I'm not on crack.

318
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,233
I'm straight-up
mentally ill.

319
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,537
Sure.

320
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:24,874
I got
mental-health issues.

321
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,417
Sure. Well, you know,
who doesn't, really?

322
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,457
Hey, has anyone seen Liz?
Or Pete?

323
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,796
She went out.

324
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:35,338
Well, who's in charge
when they're not here?

325
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:36,500
I'm in charge.

326
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:38,044
Oh. Okay.

327
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:41,447
Um, well,
I'm not sure about this costume.

328
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:42,854
I think it's hot.

329
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,554
Thank you.
I'm Jenna, by the way.

330
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,636
Miss Maroney, I got
the hemorrhoid cream you wanted.

331
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,375
It's for my face.

332
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:57,652
Well, wherever you're putting
it, I think it's working.

333
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,398
You know,
I don't think you'd like it,

334
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:04,739
'cause we work
a lot of hours

335
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,576
and it's live TV,
which is risky.

336
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,242
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I like risky.

337
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:09,914
See, me and you,
we play the game.

338
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:11,425
We know
how to be acceptable.

339
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,522
"Hello, great meeting.
I drink coffee, please."

340
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:17,539
This show is our chance
to break the shackles.

341
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:19,909
'Cause the white dudes
want to see us fail.

342
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:21,781
What white dudes?

343
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:22,980
All of 'em.

344
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:26,686
Jack Donaghy, General Electric,
George Bush, Karl Robe.

345
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,028
Karl Robe, you say?

346
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:30,697
Affirmative action was designed
to keep women and minorities

347
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,869
in competition with each other,
to distract us

348
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:36,213
while white dudes inject AIDS
into our chicken nuggets.

349
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:38,053
That's a metaphor.

350
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:39,390
Sure.

351
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,227
<i>You should tell that
to U S Weekly.</i>

352
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,205
Hey, Lemon,
you like karaoke?

353
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,213
I know a joint.

354
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:50,047
No, I've got to wrap up
this lunch meeting, Tracy.

355
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:54,556
I'll take you.
I'll take you.

356
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,638
I just got to make
a quick stop first.

357
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:02,814
You know what?

358
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:04,652
When people say
they need to make a quick stop,

359
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,321
they usually mean
at the bank or at the store.

360
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,869
No, thank you.

361
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,737
You know what?
This is for computer classes.

362
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:15,076
You know why
I should do this TV show, Lemon?

363
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,618
I really don't.

364
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,213
To get you rich.

365
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:20,852
'Cause you know if I'm on that
TV show, it's gonna blow up.

366
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,559
How do you know
I'm not rich?

367
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,069
Your teeth.

368
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:27,109
You got to think
like these strippers, Lemon.

369
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,443
They know the window
of opportunity

370
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:29,780
is only open for a moment.

371
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:31,287
You got to get in
while you're young,

372
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,859
get the money, and get out.

373
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:34,691
Yeah, well,
I'm not a sex worker, Tracy.

374
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,131
I don't have sex
for a living.

375
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:37,431
Neither do we.

376
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,973
Neither do they.

377
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,477
Yes, they do.

378
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:54,334
Where's my phone?

379
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,040
ß Whoa, whoa, whoa ß

380
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:58,849
ß Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa ß

381
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,395
ß We are strong! ß

382
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:07,234
ß No one can tell us
we're wrong! ß

383
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:11,942
ß Searching our hearts
for so long! ß

384
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:13,616
He's got charisma.

385
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:17,289
No, that's Charisma
over there.

386
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:19,806
"Girlie Show."

387
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,969
Kenneth,
send me a car, okay?

388
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,709
What is your location?

389
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,414
Dark Sensations
in the Bronx.

390
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,119
I wish you were here.

391
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:30,722
Mr. Donaghy does not get us
showbiz people.

392
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,600
Let me talk to Pete,
okay?

393
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,573
Oh, Pete got fired
this morning.

394
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,772
That's so weird
that you don't know that.

395
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:43,961
Jack Donaghy thinks

396
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,061
he's gonna come into my house
and mess with my show?!

397
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,474
Hell no!

398
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,140
Jenna and I worked for years
to get this show.

399
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:54,188
You know,
I moved from Chicago for this.

400
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,193
From Chicago?

401
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:57,424
I was
in Scottie Pippin's wedding.

402
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,765
Now Donaghy
is trying to steal it from us.

403
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,209
He already fired Pete,
who is a great producer.

404
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,877
Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.

405
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,979
You know what?

406
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,889
I quit.
He can suck it.

407
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:11,557
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, suck it, Pete.

408
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,731
No, you're not listening.
You're not a good listener.

409
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,075
20 minutes to air.

410
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,084
But Liz said we were
cutting the cat-lady sketch.

411
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:20,417
She said it stinks.
Ouch.

412
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:24,484
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humor is universal.

413
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:26,160
I just don't think
that I'm good in it.

414
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,535
Do you think
I'm good in it?

415
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:29,201
I think this is your opportunity
to go out there

416
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,712
and prove everybody wrong.

417
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:32,374
What? What do you mean?
Who's everybody?

418
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:34,046
The network
that wanted to fire you,

419
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,887
the focus groups
that said you had a weird eye...

420
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,258
You mean this eye?

421
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:38,924
Okay, this eye,
it doesn't open all the way

422
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:40,595
because when I was little,
my sister peed in it.

423
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,107
Tonight is your opportunity
to go out there

424
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,610
and change
all of our minds.

425
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:45,774
What?!

426
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,787
Where is Liz?!

427
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,587
Liz!

428
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,205
Get down!

429
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:03,858
<i>Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.</i>

430
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:05,022
Is Liz back yet?

431
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:07,500
No. Which cat
do you want Jenna to carry?

432
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:08,596
I'm sorry?

433
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,609
Which cat?
Oh.

434
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:14,445
I want... that one.

435
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:17,788
<i>Jack Donaghy to the forum,
please. Jack Donaghy.</i>

436
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:21,494
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.

437
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:29,850
Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off.
Where do you live?

438
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,189
The studio.

439
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:32,697
I want you
to drop me at the studio.

440
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,202
I want to tell Donaghy
to his face that I quit,

441
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:37,037
and I want to do it
in front of the whole crew

442
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:39,613
so that they know
he didn't fire me.

443
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:42,448
I want to see that.

444
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:48,865
ß It's time
for "The Girlie Show" ß

445
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:54,412
Oh, oh, pull over!
Pull over here!

446
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,920
Tracy, I don't have time
for this.

447
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,550
Right here.

448
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:02,662
This is where I grew up.

449
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:06,812
This is
the Jordan family estate?

450
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,318
Wasn't no Jordan family
nothing.

451
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,619
This is where
I was in foster care.

452
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,595
Oh, sorry.

453
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:16,636
Me and two other dudes and
a girl with messed-up fingers.

454
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:20,741
I'm so lucky
I got out of here.

455
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:24,156
It's not luck.

456
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,989
I mean,
you got out of here

457
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:30,535
because you're very talented
and people love you and...

458
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,076
Are you peeing?

459
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:40,862
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.

460
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:43,369
Last time I saw him,
he was riding the crane camera.

461
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:45,704
Oh, I have Pete for you.

462
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:48,078
Pete, oh, my God,
I didn't know.

463
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:49,915
No, hey, listen,
it will give me a chance

464
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,889
to spend more time
with my kids.

465
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,224
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.

466
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,230
No, no, no, no, no.

467
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,234
You have the best job in
New York. Don't quit over this.

468
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:57,863
Don't buy
all the hot dogs, okay?

469
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:00,536
I don't want to do this
without you.

470
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,244
Hey, I thought
we cut the cat-lady sketch.

471
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,295
We're two minutes short!

472
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:11,800
So, let me introduce myself.

473
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,472
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.

474
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,647
She's using a real cat?

475
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,126
I cast that cat myself.

476
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,963
Why, they are my...
Aah!

477
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:25,302
Ow!

478
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,604
Oh!

479
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,282
No, no, no, no, he's okay!

480
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:34,384
I need you to talk
for two minutes.

481
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:36,023
About what?

482
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:39,003
Anything.
All right.

483
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,841
These cats are more
than just pets, sir.

484
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,409
Excuse me.
Where's the manager?

485
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:46,584
I'm from the government,

486
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:49,426
and I'm here to inspect
your chicken nuggets.

487
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,609
Uh-oh.
Look at shorty.

488
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:59,449
This honky grandma
be trippin'!

489
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,961
What's up, America?!
I'm coming into your house live!

490
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:09,808
Let me hear you say,
"We love you, Tracy!"

491
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,978
We love you, Tracy!

492
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,820
I am the third heat!

493
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:19,769
He's brilliant.

494
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,179
Are you drunk?

495
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,850
Yes.

496
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:29,521
Why did you fire Pete?

497
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:30,692
Why did you disappear
all night?

498
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:32,464
Is this some kind of
a power play?

499
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:34,474
Yeah, yeah,
it's not so fun being hands-on

500
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,274
with these bloodsuckers,
is it?

501
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:37,714
Can we talk about this
on Monday?

502
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,379
No, I want Pete back.

503
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:42,221
I want it in writing
that Jenna's job is safe.

504
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:47,064
And I want a cappuccino machine
for the writers' room.

505
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:48,234
Fine.

506
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:49,745
I thought
you were gonna quit.

507
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,818
Yeah, well, you don't know
everything about me.

508
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:54,186
You weigh 127 pounds.

509
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,597
Yeah.

510
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:01,367
Oh, yeah!

511
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:04,914
Holla at your boy!

512
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:13,692
Hey, you will be hearing
from Peanut's lawyer.

513
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,367
Good night, sleep tight.

514
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,709
I can't wait to do this
with you every week.
