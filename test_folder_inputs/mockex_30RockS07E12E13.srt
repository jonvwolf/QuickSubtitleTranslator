00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:03,396
Janet, shoes and socks.

3
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:05,329
Okay, let go of the comic book.
Let's try and get your jacket on.

00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:12,166
- Let's go, let's go!
- Don't forget these!

[Smooches]

8
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:16,243
All right.

9
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,973
Have a good day!
Have fun at home!

[Clock ticking]

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,017
Any recommendations for the
best place to buy a girl's bike

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,184
on the Upper West Side?

14
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,558
She's eight.

15
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:37,530
I'm sorry, what's a "girl's" bike?
Is that like a "girl" doctor?

16
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,498
Go back to Saudi Arabia, Hitler!

17
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:42,593
You're buying a bike but not a helmet?
The head is where the child's brain is!

18
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,600
Why don't you get educated,
Double Hitler?!

19
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:46,465
I was gonna buy a helmet.

20
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:47,906
Helmets inhibit brain development!

21
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:49,636
You might as well give
your darling child vaccines,

22
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,140
which studies show
cause homosexuality.

23
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:54,340
So what?
My 2-year-old is super gay,

24
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:56,246
and we love him
more than a straight child

25
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,319
because he doesn't rape!

26
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:02,016
Gentlemen, yesterday I moved
Kabletown's customer service

27
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:04,422
to a part of India
that has no phones.

28
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:07,427
We're now providing the same level
of service to our subscribers

29
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:08,928
at zero the cost.

30
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,499
This is a Six Sigma
Wheel of Domination.

31
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:14,125
It's a motivational tool
I used back at GE,

32
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:18,036
and it will be replacing Kabletown's,
uh, kitten in spaghetti.

33
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,665
Once this circle
is completely filled in,

34
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:23,410
we will be a perfect company.

35
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,537
And then we'll be able to get
even better trophy wives...

36
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,273
- half-Asian ones!
- Oh.

- [ Telephones ringing]
- MAN: Jack Donaghy's office.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
You can't go in there!

39
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,179
I never told you this, but I once came
up late at night looking for Jack,

40
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,621
and you were in a wedding dress
dancing with one of his suits.

41
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:39,023
Mr. Donaghy will see you now.

42
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:43,427
Stay-at-home Lemon.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,659
Did you already run out of things
to do today?

44
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:47,401
[Scoffs ] What? No!

45
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,730
- You are.
- It's understandable.

46
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,129
For the past seven years,

47
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:52,331
you put out dozens of fires
every day --

48
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,500
not including the real ones
Tracy would set.

49
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:57,510
To keep away Frankensteins,
which, as far as we know, worked.

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,637
My point is, you need the outlet.

51
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,012
Without work...
[imitates explosion]

52
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:03,482
I have plenty of new outlets.

53
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:05,484
I ran this morning for 30 minutes.

54
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:06,679
Does that include dry heaving?

55
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,655
And wet! And, sure, okay, I thought
I'd have a job right now.

56
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,022
But I don't <i>need</i> to work.

57
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:15,062
What about money? You know "TGS"
is only syndicated in Greece.

[High-pitched tone]

60
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,593
We'll be fine.
Criss has gone back to work.

61
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,399
He has a degree in ethnomusicology
from Wesleyan,

62
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:26,667
so he's a receptionist
at a dental office.

63
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:28,640
And I didn't come here
looking for something to do.

64
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,507
I just thought
I would check in on you

65
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,012
because you're
the emotionally fragile one.

67
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,276
Which is a combination
of "hogwash" and "poppycock."

68
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,011
I'm just saying,
if my mother told me

69
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:41,214
that everything I had been raised
to believe was a lie and then died,

70

is that she wanted me to be happy,

72

and obviously I am.

Take a look at my new view.

74
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,564
From up here,
I can see the whole island --

75
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,031
a city built
on the religion of capitalism,

76
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,602

on the swinish multitude.

and the bicycle-riders,

as a god.

83
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,348
And this makes you... happy?

84
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,314
It should.

85
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,722
You know, I'm reminded
of something Yoda once said.

86
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,760

be there for me no matter what.

00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,434
Because we have hiring quotas!

111
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,910
Okay, well, I actually think
there might be a show in my life:

112

Those are all on my list
of "TV No-No Words."

and forget about their problems
when they watch TV.

118
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:02,294
They don't want to watch
some angry New York crankypants...

119
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,864
make that face! Exactly!

120

that people actually want to watch!

thrown in his face

122

about something a lot lately,

he was saying "nougats."

Someone leaked your new salary.

343
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,229
Occupy Wall Street
is having a conniption!

344
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,164
- Really?
- They burned you in effigy!

345
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,634
The hair went up
like a Roman candle!

346
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,098
And the Democrats, they don't even
know what to do with themselves!

347
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,673
Just look at this jackass.

348
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,101
Jack Donaghy
is an economic war criminal.

349
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,337
If the Democratic Party
controlled Congress,

350
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,607
I would see to it that he was punished
in the worst way possible --

351
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,650
by having to come down here
and listen to us.

352
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,511
God, I feel like I have
a macropenis right now!

353
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,000
Ms. Lemon, how funny!

354
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,095
I was planning to call you,
and now here you are!

355
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,973
Now, about our conversation earlier --

356
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:33,475
Yes, about that.

357
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,442
You know, I've been thinking,
and you were right.

358
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,309
America doesn't want to see me.

359
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,644
America wants to see...

360
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,012
John Hardly.

361
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,382
He loves his family,
but he hates the rat race.

362
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,477
He's... "Hardly Working."

363
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,420
KENNETH: I'm so sorry, pass.

364
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,359
But I do have something
you'd be perfect for.

365
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,262
One last chance for "TGS"
to make America say, "What? Why?"

366
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,095
What are you talking about?

367
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,260
Well, it turns out
Mr. Jordan's "TGS" contract

368
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,202
contains some
rather unusual clauses.

369
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,332
And I don't mean those two Santas
I saw kissing on the subway.

370
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,402
"If fewer than 150 episodes of 'TGS'
are produced in total,

371
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,108
Mr. Jordan shall be paid
a penalty of $30 million."

372
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,183
30?

373
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,653
Ms. Lemon,
"TGS" has done 149 shows.

374
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,520
So we're gonna need you to go ahead
and do one more.

375
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:25,288
I need a job, Kenneth,
not one more episode of "TGS".

376
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,386
You are contractually required
to write and produce

377
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,124
all episodes of "TGS".

378
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,030
So, see you tomorrow?

379
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,125
Wow.
You've really changed, Kenneth.

380
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,102
I don't think so.
You look nice today!

381
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,333
Shut your chin slit.

382
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,669
Yes, ma'am!

383
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,109
WOMAN: Welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport.

384
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,581
Follow yellow signs to baggage claim
and ground transportation.

385
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,460
Excuse me, ma'am, do you need
a wheelchair to baggage claim?

386
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,463
[Dog squeals]

387
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,700
Shut it down.

388
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,034
I will return to my first love --
Broadway!

389
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,767
You Eastern-European-knockoff
Mr. Potato Heads!

390
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,577
Why haven't you come to see me?!

391
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,773
Why didn't you return
any of my calls?!

392
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,142
I tried, sir, but no one answered.

393
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,345
I'm Tracy Jordan!
I don't answer phones!

394
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,319
Kenneth,
you once made a promise

395
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,357
that you would always be there
for me.

396
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,256
I know. I'm sorry.
I would never break a promise.

397
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,829
Good, 'cause I need you
to do something for me.

398
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,222
Of course. Just name it!

399
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,663
Kenneth, I need you
to take back your promise.

400
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,825
Sir?

401
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,534
I know what it is
to blow up overnight.

402
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,263
And I'm not talking about my gout.

403
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,308
When I got big, a lot of people
from my past wanted stuff from me,

404
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,740
and, well...

405
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,312
I don't want to be
that person for you.

406
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,575
So, like the snakes I kept
in my dressing room,

407
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:53,706
I release you.

408
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,683
Mr. Jordan...

409
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,553
Thank you, sir!

410
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,158
I think I'm gonna need a tissue.

411
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,792
Am I supposed to drop this
on the floor?

412
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,837
And while we're naming things,

413
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,233
my car ran out of gas
on the Long Island Expressway.

414
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,809
Yes, sir.

415
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,270
[Snifﬂes]

416
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,641
Okay, Jack, I need a job.
I'm looking for six figures --

417
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,242
eight if you're counting cents,
which I fell for once before.

418
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,582
Not cool, The Gap!

419
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,884
I'd love to help you, Lemon,
but I don't think I can.

420
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,887
I resigned as CEO of Kabletown
an hour ago.

421
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:37,887
What? Why?

422
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,787
Because I felt nothing.

423
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,865
I got the job,
I pissed off my enemies --

424
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,191
Pelosi, Maddow, Baldwin.

425
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,200
It should have been
the greatest moment of my life.

426
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,795
No-no-no, no, no!
Eyes off the window!

427
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,341
Focus on Lemon.
What am I gonna do now?

428
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,774
I could try and help you --

429
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,336
make some calls and see
what bridges I haven't burned --

430
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,676
but I'm not going to,

431
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,840
for your own good.

432
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,214
Work is never going
to make you happy, Lemon.

433
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,412
And anyone who tells you differently
is a fool.

434
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,682
Are you kidding me?!

435
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,189
What have we been talking about
for the last seven years?!

436
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,190
I don't know anymore.

437
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,887
For the first time in my life,
I don't know what I need.

438
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,424
Maybe I'll buy a boat.

439
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,261
Oh, my God.

440
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,801
This whole time you've been
telling me how to run my life,

441
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,461
you didn't know
what you were talking about.

442
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,301
You're just an alcoholic
with a great voice.

443
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,874
Careful, Lemon.
You're playing with fire.

444
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,542
You made me
buy into this whole life!

445
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,375
When I met you, I was perfectly happy
with what I had --

446
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,678
eating night cheese and transitioning
my pajamas into daywear.

447
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,252
You're the one who told me
to want more.

448
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,878
And now, when I need you most,
you are bailing on me?!

449
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,321
You're an adult, Lemon.
You didn't have to listen to me.

450
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,222
Really?!
When was that an option?!

451
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,852
Look, if you want someone to blame,
blame yourself.

452
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,363
You're the one
who wormed your way into my brain

453
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,626
with your endless hand-wringing
and feelings.

454
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,703
I used to be a shark,
and then you un-shark-ulated me.

455
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,432
I called you up here for one meeting
seven years ago,

456
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,530
and you kept coming up!

457
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,631
[sighs]

458
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,406
So we ruined each other.
Good to know.

459
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,778
You know, it's for the best
that my show is over

460
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,647
and you've quit
and we're all going our separate ways.

461
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,346
I guess you and I
were just a boss and his employee.

462
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,717
And now we're not anymore.

463
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,314
Yes, that pretty much sums it up.

464
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,486
There!
You're no longer special to him!

465
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,463
Get out!
Get out of our lives!

466
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,227
Yes! [Laughing maniacally]

467
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,841
Put your helmet on, Pete.

468
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,604
This last episode
is gonna be a hot mess.

469
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,235
How so?

470
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,713
If "TGS" doesn't do one more show,
Tracy gets $30 million.

471
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,475
Oh NBC.

472
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,552
The same company that suggested
we get flush buddies to save water.

473
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,881
Liz, Tracy has landed.

474
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,580
Of course he has,
because if he didn't --

475
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,657
He'd be in breach of contract
and wouldn't get the money.

476
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,590
Which means he's gonna try to find
another way to ruin the show.

477
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,215
<font color="#ffffff">7x13
Last Lunch</font>

478
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,925
Seven years,
and Tracy never changed.

479
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,897
Well, people are who they are, Liz.

00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,297
[Cell phone vibrates]

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,996
[Southern accent] This is
Dan Silversmith with Carolina Mutual.

482
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,603
I can't talk right now.
I'm with a customer.

483
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,934
Well, whatever sideways nonsense
Tracy tries to pull,

484
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,512
I'm gonna hold him down.

485
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,377
I'm gonna hold him down like
that machine Kathy Geiss invented

486
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,677
that hugs old people.

487
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,945
My God, this will change
elder care forever.

489
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,418
- [ Gasps]
- Whoops. Nope.

490
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,388
Hello, Tracy.

491
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,950
So, one last show.
Pretty crazy, huh?

492
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,894
Indeed, Elizabeth.
I hope nothing goes wrong.

493
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,691
Why would it?

494
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,698
I mean, you're here,
fulfilling your contract.

495
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,995
Sure am, L.L.

496
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,737
The only thing that can stop this show
is an act of God.

497
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:35,896
Or if some genius
figured out a way

No! Nice try!

500
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,940
Get that out of here!

501
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,539
It's the final showdown, Tray.

502
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,049
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

503
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,480
The night is young,
and neither are you.

506
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,591
Okay. Thank you, everybody,
for coming in on such short notice.

507
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,667
I know some of you
have already gotten other jobs.

508
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,961
Not me.

00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,468

00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,368
We have been given
a second chance to end this right,

511

00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,314
how people get sloppy
when they fake their own deaths.

851
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,475
You said that.

852
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,881
The trick is
to wait for the right moment --

853
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,620
a day when it makes sense
to have a drink or two.

854
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,280
I don't know,
maybe a sad occasion

855

when something's
coming to an end.

856

with a glass in your hand.

857
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,857

they'll be like,

858
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,260
"I did see him drinking."

Although I've only been on this boat
a minute,

916
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,357
I've already realized
two things about myself.

917
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,792
One -- I could totally be
a professional boat model.

918
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,692
And two -- I do know one thing

919
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,391
that has made me happy
these last seven years.

920
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:21,561
Lemon, there is a word,
a once-special word

921
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,833
that's been tragically co-opted
by the romance-industrial complex.

922
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,671
And I would hate to use it here
and have you think

923
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,143
that I am suggesting
any kind of romantic sentiment,

924
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,438
let alone an invitation
to scale bone mountain.

925
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:38,486
It's a word that comes to us
by way of the old high German "luba"

926
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:42,490
from the Latin "lubere,"
meaning "to be pleasing."

927
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,756
So I am going to use this word
to describe how I feel about you

928
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,060
in the way that our Anglo-Saxon
forefathers would have used it

929
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:54,796
in reference to, say, uh,
a hot bowl of bear meat

930
