1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,079
<i>As a doctor, you spend</i>
<i>about a third of your nights</i>

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,435
<i>sleeping at the hospital,</i>
<i>but in truth,</i>

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,715
<i>not a lot of sleeping takes place.</i>

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,633
- Dr Reid.
- I'm not sucking my thumb.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,314
Mr Rodriguez is coding.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,437
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,389
<i>You learn to appreciate</i>
<i>the little things,</i>

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,277
<i>like waking up in your own bed.</i>

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,113
<i>Of course, if there's someone</i>
<i>there with you...</i>

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,034
- Sorry I woke you.
- I'll live.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>...that's just gravy.</i>

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,993
<i>Yep, there's nothing</i>
<i>like mornings at home.</i>

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,868
- Hey, there, sunshine.
- Morning.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,791
<i>I forgot Carla</i>
<i>is staying with us</i>

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,474
<i>while her building</i>
<i>is being fumigated.</i>

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,917
Hey, don't use Rowdy to cover up
your giblets. Apologize.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,753
Tell me why we have no milk
or orange juice,

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,751
but, like, 40 fruit cups in here?

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,354
<i>The average resident</i>
<i>owes over $ 100,000</i>

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>in med school loans and makes</i>
<i>about as much as a waiter.</i>

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,795
<i>So you have to do things</i>
<i>to make ends meet.</i>

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,235
<i>Like you can cover</i>
<i>someone's shift.</i>

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,712
<i>Or you can steal stuff</i>
<i>from the hospital.</i>

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,997
<i>Or you can moonlight</i>
<i>at an urgent care centre.</i>

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,313
<i>Or you can steal stuff.</i>

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,158
<i>Or your dad</i>
<i>can pay for everything.</i>

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,071
<i>Or... Well, you know.</i>

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,549
- Is it clear?
- Come on, come on.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,358
Go! Go! Run!

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,631
- Hold up.
- Why?

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,156
There's been several thefts.
We're doing bag checks.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,196
What about that guy
taking scrubs?

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,679
Hey, Tom.

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,876
He doesn't have a bag.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,190
Go ahead, narc. I'm clean.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,759
Yeah?

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,549
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>if he was checking my trunk...</i>

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,672
- Pudding. Score!
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,234
Get me a butterscotch, buddy.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,639
Come on!

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,474
I did that cardioversion,
I extubated Mrs Bays,

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,755
and I finished
all the transfer summaries

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,798
- on the nursing-home patients.
- Well, what can I say?

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,236
You did exceptional work today,
Newbie, and I'm proud of you.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,356
<i>Did he just wink at me?</i>

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,399
- Is there a problem?
- I'm just so happy.

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,152
- No, no problem, sir.
- Attaboy.

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,549
And, Laverne,

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,872
what is that delightfully
naught-ay scent you're wearing?

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,633
It's called Twelve-Hour Shift.

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,440
- Yeah, it is.
- Why the hell is he so cheery?

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,795
Because I did
exceptional work today.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,836
Hey, babe.

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,674
I ordered the fight on pay-per-view,
got a six-pack of beer.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,548
- We are leaving this second.
- Hop on, Blondie. Come here.

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
<i>Oh, Perry gonna get</i>
<i>some loving</i>

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,272
<i>Perry gonna get some loving</i>
<i>Oh, Perry gonna get some...</i>

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,638
Is there one bathroom
in this damn place

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,950
that has toilet paper,
or do I have to start

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,474
carrying around
a basket of leaves?

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,033
This is the reason why
your headache didn't go away.

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,398
That's actually pronounced
analgesic, not "anal"-gesic.

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,869
Sir, the pills go in your mouth.

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,669
We're going to be short
a doctor tomorrow,

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,832
so if you've got a friend
that wants an extra 300 bucks...

66
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,072
And they said they'll pay you
200 bucks. Cash money.

67
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,516
Sweet! Dude, you are
like the best friend ever.

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,398
Hell, yeah.

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,111
My mother
lives with me all year.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,589
My Aunt has to take care of her
for one week

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,511
and she won't stop bitching.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,512
My dad's coming in to town
for a conference tomorrow.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,751
- You don't seem stressed out.
- I haven't pooed in six days.

74
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,037
Twice this morning,
and I haven't even had my coffee yet.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,509
You really pick odd things
to brag about.

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,989
I'm just saying,
if I had to get three by lunch,

77
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,832
I probably could.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,151
Hey, guys.
Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,075
<i>Obstetrics and Gynaecology</i>
<i>is a specialty</i>

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,071
<i>that's usually</i>
<i>dominated by women.</i>

81
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,593
Dr Reid, I'm Dr Gerson.
We were just wondering

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,114
if you have any thoughts
about your specialty,

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,794
because we really think
you're OB/GYN material.

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,872
<i>Being a Gyno Girl</i>
<i>is a lot like being in a sorority.</i>

85
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,989
JD, I can't go with Dr Gerson
because I have to help you, right?

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,277
Give me a second. I'm figuring
something out for a patient.

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,673
I'm glad we all finally
experimented with each other,

88
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,558
but I'll never do it again.

89
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,596
Dammit.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,277
- Julie!
- Hey, Rob! Good to see you.

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,555
Hey, Dan!

92
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,030
God, I just hate that every doctor
you ever gave a drug sample to

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,714
sniffs around you
like a little puppy dog.

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,509
I never gave those guys anything.
I slept with them.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,472
Great.

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,113
Those Gyno Girls
are putting the pressure on.

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,192
We must have looked
at a hundred women's bajingos today.

98
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,669
Bajingo, bajingo, bajingo.

99
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,513
I mean, I can't even look
at my own bajingo, you know?

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,989
Is that because
it looks so much like a vagina?

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,514
Carla, there's people!
You know, forget it.

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,830
- OK.
- Hit it.

103
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,834
Good, good. Your mom
re-did the bedroom again.

104
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,309
and I was riding
in an ambulance all night.

105
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,919
- I can't afford this place.
- Elliot, I'm $130,000 in debt.
