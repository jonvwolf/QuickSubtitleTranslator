1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,079
<i>As a doctor, you spend</i>
<i>about a third of your nights</i>

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,435
<i>sleeping at the hospital,</i>
<i>but in truth,</i>

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,715
<i>not a lot of sleeping takes place.</i>

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,633
- Dr Reid.
- I'm not sucking my thumb.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,314
Mr Rodriguez is coding.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,437
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,389
<i>You learn to appreciate</i>
<i>the little things,</i>

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,277
<i>like waking up in your own bed.</i>

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,113
<i>Of course, if there's someone</i>
<i>there with you...</i>

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,034
- Sorry I woke you.
- I'll live.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>...that's just gravy.</i>

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,993
<i>Yep, there's nothing</i>
<i>like mornings at home.</i>

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,868
- Hey, there, sunshine.
- Morning.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,791
<i>I forgot Carla</i>
<i>is staying with us</i>

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,474
<i>while her building</i>
<i>is being fumigated.</i>

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,917
Hey, don't use Rowdy to cover up
your giblets. Apologize.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,753
Tell me why we have no milk
or orange juice,

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,751
but, like, 40 fruit cups in here?

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,354
<i>The average resident</i>
<i>owes over $ 100,000</i>

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>in med school loans and makes</i>
<i>about as much as a waiter.</i>

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,795
<i>So you have to do things</i>
<i>to make ends meet.</i>

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,235
<i>Like you can cover</i>
<i>someone's shift.</i>

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,712
<i>Or you can steal stuff</i>
<i>from the hospital.</i>

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,997
<i>Or you can moonlight</i>
<i>at an urgent care centre.</i>

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,313
<i>Or you can steal stuff.</i>

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,158
<i>Or your dad</i>
<i>can pay for everything.</i>

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,071
<i>Or... Well, you know.</i>

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,549
- Is it clear?
- Come on, come on.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,358
Go! Go! Run!

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,631
- Hold up.
- Why?

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,156
There's been several thefts.
We're doing bag checks.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,196
What about that guy
taking scrubs?

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,679
Hey, Tom.

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,876
He doesn't have a bag.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,190
Go ahead, narc. I'm clean.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,759
Yeah?

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,549
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>if he was checking my trunk...</i>

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,672
- Pudding. Score!
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,234
Get me a butterscotch, buddy.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,639
Come on!

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,474
I did that cardioversion,
I extubated Mrs Bays,

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,755
and I finished
all the transfer summaries

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,798
- on the nursing-home patients.
- Well, what can I say?

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,236
You did exceptional work today,
Newbie, and I'm proud of you.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,356
<i>Did he just wink at me?</i>

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,399
- Is there a problem?
- I'm just so happy.

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,152
- No, no problem, sir.
- Attaboy.

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,549
And, Laverne,

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,872
what is that delightfully
naught-ay scent you're wearing?

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,633
It's called Twelve-Hour Shift.

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,440
- Yeah, it is.
- Why the hell is he so cheery?

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,795
Because I did
exceptional work today.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,836
Hey, babe.

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,674
I ordered the fight on pay-per-view,
got a six-pack of beer.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,548
- We are leaving this second.
- Hop on, Blondie. Come here.

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
<i>Oh, Perry gonna get</i>
<i>some loving</i>

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,272
<i>Perry gonna get some loving</i>
<i>Oh, Perry gonna get some...</i>

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,638
Is there one bathroom
in this damn place

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,950
that has toilet paper,
or do I have to start

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,474
carrying around
a basket of leaves?

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,033
This is the reason why
your headache didn't go away.

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,398
That's actually pronounced
analgesic, not "anal"-gesic.

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,869
Sir, the pills go in your mouth.

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,669
We're going to be short
a doctor tomorrow,

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,832
so if you've got a friend
that wants an extra 300 bucks...

66
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,072
And they said they'll pay you
200 bucks. Cash money.

67
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,516
Sweet! Dude, you are
like the best friend ever.

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,398
Hell, yeah.

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,111
My mother
lives with me all year.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,589
My Aunt has to take care of her
for one week

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,511
and she won't stop bitching.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,512
My dad's coming in to town
for a conference tomorrow.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,751
- You don't seem stressed out.
- I haven't pooed in six days.

74
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,037
Twice this morning,
and I haven't even had my coffee yet.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,509
You really pick odd things
to brag about.

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,989
I'm just saying,
if I had to get three by lunch,

77
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,832
I probably could.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,151
Hey, guys.
Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,075
<i>Obstetrics and Gynaecology</i>
<i>is a specialty</i>

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,071
<i>that's usually</i>
<i>dominated by women.</i>

81
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,593
Dr Reid, I'm Dr Gerson.
We were just wondering

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,114
if you have any thoughts
about your specialty,

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,794
because we really think
you're OB/GYN material.

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,872
<i>Being a Gyno Girl</i>
<i>is a lot like being in a sorority.</i>

85
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,989
JD, I can't go with Dr Gerson
because I have to help you, right?

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,277
Give me a second. I'm figuring
something out for a patient.

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,673
I'm glad we all finally
experimented with each other,

88
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,558
but I'll never do it again.

89
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,596
Dammit.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,277
- Julie!
- Hey, Rob! Good to see you.

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,555
Hey, Dan!

92
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,030
God, I just hate that every doctor
you ever gave a drug sample to

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,714
sniffs around you
like a little puppy dog.

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,509
I never gave those guys anything.
I slept with them.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,472
Great.

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,113
Those Gyno Girls
are putting the pressure on.

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,192
We must have looked
at a hundred women's bajingos today.

98
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,669
Bajingo, bajingo, bajingo.

99
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,513
I mean, I can't even look
at my own bajingo, you know?

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,989
Is that because
it looks so much like a vagina?

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,514
Carla, there's people!
You know, forget it.

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,875
I'm gonna tell them
I'm not interested.

103
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,951
I think you should.

104
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,198
- Sir, why are you laughing?
- Who knows?

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,034
It could be the funny face
I made with my peas.

106
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,476
But, gun to my head,
I'd say I'm laughing

107
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,472
at the notion that you could
stand up to anyone.

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,348
There we go.

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,715
<i>Moonlighting sucks,</i>
<i>but Turk and I make do.</i>

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,997
Now, will a lollipop
put a smile on your face?

111
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,868
How about if Dr Turk sings
<i>Jimmy Crack Corn?</i>

112
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,155
How about if Dr Turk sings
<i>Jimmy Crack Corn</i>

113
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,674
as Neil Diamond?

114
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,830
- OK.
- Hit it.

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,153
Hold this for me.

116
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,475
Dr Dorian, we could
use you again tomorrow

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,155
if you'd like to make
another $300.

118
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,879
300?

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,317
<i>Luckily for Turk,</i>
<i>revenge is a dish best served cold.</i>

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,391
<i>Not unlike</i>
<i>this tapioca pudding.</i>

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,517
We're zeroing in on the guy
that's been stealing stuff.

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,558
Oh. Well, that's good.

123
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,031
Yep. In fact, right now
I'm dusting for fingerprints.

124
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,112
- Really?
- Nah, I'm just dusting.

125
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,672
I finished those discharge
dictations you wanted,

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,797
and I was able to get
Mrs Jeskie on the transplant list.

127
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,633
<i>And here comes the wink.</i>

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,712
<i>OK, maybe I'll start it off.</i>

129
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,909
My God, Sabrina, you had better
tell me you had laser eye surgery

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,390
and they accidentally severed
the muscle that holds that lid up,

131
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,357
because you did not
just wink at me.

132
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,113
I didn't mean anything by it.
I wink at everybody.

133
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,078
Hey, Dr Kelso.

134
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,515
Save it
for the bathhouses, sport.

135
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,874
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

136
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,518
Don't be angry at Bambi.

137
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,239
I'm not. My girlfriend
serviced most of the staff.

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,470
I'm proud of her commitment
to medicine.

139
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,630
What about the women
you've slept with?

140
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,188
Your ex-wife, that med student,
your ex-wife,

141
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,475
the radiology nurse,
your ex-wife...

142
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,154
- Would you get off my ex-wife?
- I will if you will.

143
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,276
Dammit. Gosh, now I'm too proud
of you to be mad at you.

144
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,996
So, Dad, how are things at home?

145
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,834
Good, good. Your mom
re-did the bedroom again.

146
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,229
I'm going to keep mine
the way it is.

147
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,074
You don't want to be a couple
that does everything together.

148
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,873
Sorry.

149
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,951
- Hello?
- I just wanted you to know,

150
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,712
I faced up
to those Gyno Girls

151
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,155
with a very strong and clear
"no, thank you."

152
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,437
Yes, I heard about your note.

153
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,556
The point is that I'm out.

154
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,198
That was your mom.
She said to say something.

155
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,669
So, did Dr Gerson
ever contact you?

156
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,273
You told her to talk to me?

157
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,193
She went to med school
with a colleague at my hospital.

158
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,555
Come on, I want to go
see the department.

159
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,158
Paging Dr Backbone
to the Bajingo Ward.

160
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,950
You wanna grab
a couple of beers tonight?

161
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,349
Can't. I'm moonlighting
at urgent care.

162
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,476
That's funny.
The lady didn't call me.

163
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,949
Because I found out
you stole $100 from me,

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,110
- and I Marcia Brady'd your ass.
- What?

165
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,395
When Marcia worked
at the ice-cream shop,

166
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,914
and she got Jan a job,
and they liked Jan better

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,399
so they fired Marcia.

168
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,153
<i>Marcia Gets Creamed,</i>
season five, episode three.

169
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,310
Don't ever question me
on <i>The Bunch.</i>

170
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,789
There's no way
they liked you better than me.

171
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,190
Then maybe it's because I told her
that you smoke the ganja.

172
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,068
What? That's not even true.
You're a jackass.

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,754
Where you going? Munchies?

174
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,793
- <i>Stay tuned for</i> Survivor.
- I so don't think so.

175
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,711
Hey, I was watching that.

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,394
I know, but it's my place,
so it's house rules.

177
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,199
Look, I feel like I owe you
an apology here.

178
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,032
Really? For what?

179
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,395
Just for being so jealous
and pissy lately.

180
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,710
I guess I just kinda
got hung up on the fact

181
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,950
that you were with,
you know, Dr Jasper,

182
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,157
and Dr Michaels,

183
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,435
and Dr Stone...
Was it his ear hair?

184
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,318
Is that what was so compelling
about him? Never mind.

185
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,755
The point is that
this relationship here

186
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,434
is about the present,
and it's about the future,

187
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,875
and I won't let anything
from our past

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,552
ever get in our way again.

189
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,835
- Deal?
- Deal.

190
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,878
Keys still work.

191
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,271
Excellent.

192
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,555
Jordan, please tell me you
ate a raccoon

193
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,791
and it's making its way
through your digestive system.

194
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,711
Don't worry.
It's not your baby.

195
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,712
Though not for lack of trying.
See, we have sex a lot.

196
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,758
- Who are you?
- Who do you think I am?

197
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,229
Well, you have keys
to the apartment,

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,551
so I'm gonna say the maid.

199
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,437
Julie, this is
my ex-wife, Jordan.

200
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,670
Jordan, this is
my girlfriend, Julie.

201
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,398
OK, that was a treat,
wasn't it?

202
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,391
Would you like me
to call you a cab,

203
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,597
or have the flying monkeys
bring the broom around?

204
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,274
Oh, no.
He called you his girlfriend.

205
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,193
If I were you,
I'd gather your tiny panties up,

206
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,793
because I think you're done.

207
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,713
I'm already bored by you.
I will be in the bedroom.

208
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,677
Come join me when Tubby leaves.

209
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,072
Who did that to you?

210
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,355
I was at this
fabulous hotel in Greece,

211
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,635
chock full of available,
wealthy men...

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,951
- So it was the bellboy?
- Or busboy, or pool-boy.

213
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,792
Something "boy." I don't know.

214
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,269
Anyway, when I first
found out, I panicked.

215
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,069
Then I thought, I've been drifting
through life all these years.

216
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,709
I need to look into my heart
and see what really matters to me.

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,916
Anyway, I decided
to keep the stupid kid.

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,037
Cut out the middle man
and have a therapist deliver him.

219
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,554
Honestly, Jordan,
why are you telling me this?

220
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,997
Because I've also decided
that I want you back.

221
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,274
Yep, we got him.
And he's gonna pay.

222
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,750
They're arresting him
for stealing pudding and toilet paper?

223
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,957
No, they found 20 bottles
of Vicodin in his backpack.

224
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,634
Did you steal pudding
and toilet paper?

225
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,757
What? No! I hate pudding
and I don't use toilet paper.

226
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,637
I have one of
those French things

227
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,473
that shoots water up your butt.

228
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,233
- Bidet?
- Bidet to you, sir.

229
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,632
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

230
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,029
I thought I was going
to see you last night.

231
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,917
I frickin' caught an EMT shift,

232
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,309
and I was riding
in an ambulance all night.

233
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,675
That's cool.
Did they let you run the siren?

234
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,876
I'm not talking to you. And yes.

235
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,838
- Quit being such a baby.
- Bab... You stole my job.

236
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,595
- You stole my money.
- That was a finder's fee.

237
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,398
Oh, yeah? Well, find this!

238
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,233
You should grab your crotch
when you say that.

239
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,639
Wouldn't that hurt?

240
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,438
So this is where we all hang out.
It's neat, huh?

241
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,080
It's a hellhole.

242
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,234
Dad, why...are you so set
on me being an OB/GYN?

243
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,709
Look, honey,
your highest income potential

244
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,793
as a female physician
is in obstetrics.

245
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,474
But don't you think
that maybe it's time

246
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,358
that you left those
sort of things up to me?

247
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,510
Well, since I paid
for your college,

248
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,318
your medical school, your car,

249
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,073
and now your apartment
and your living expenses,

250
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,832
I'd have to say "no."

251
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,953
Good God. Someone vomited
on my hotdog.

252
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,508
It's chilli, Dad, OK?
And you know what?

253
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,672
I appreciate everything
you've given me, but it's my life.

254
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,309
Now stop complaining
and enjoy your damn meal.

255
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,433
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

256
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,110
Jordan, I don't know
what to tell you.

257
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,997
Are you ever coming in, Perry?

258
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,038
You can join us,
but I doubt you'll fit on the bed.

259
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,317
OK, have one last fling,
but I'll be back, and until then,

260
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,311
everywhere you look,
you'll see me.

261
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,789
Everywhere anybody looks,
they'll see you.

262
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,950
- Oh, it is so on.
- Bring it.

263
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,190
Oh, God...

264
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,909
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

265
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,871
So now you're ignoring me?

266
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,554
Because of you I gotta ride
around in an ambulance

267
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,596
and you know I get carsick.

268
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,956
Come on, Turk. Turk.

269
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,873
Hey, idiot. Ha. I said
"idiot" and you looked.

270
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,474
Hey, help me carry
this computer to my van.

271
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,949
You can't just take a computer.

272
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,315
Help me or we check
the trunk of your car.

273
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,311
Stay low.

274
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,992
Look, morning sickness sucks.
Believe me, I know.

275
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,911
I've been there.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,471
Hey, Jordan, are you...
Are you crying?

277
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,030
No. I don't know.

278
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,076
I'm just completely hormonal.

279
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,913
I mean, you try going
from out-of-control horny

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,719
to clinically depressed
six times a day.

281
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,598
Give me a break. I can knock
that out on the way to work.

282
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,639
Hey, lady, I'm proud
of what you're doing here.

283
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,996
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

284
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,957
Thanks.

285
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,473
Last chance.
Do you want me or not?

286
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,598
Oh, Jordan, I'm so sorry, but...

287
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,311
Forget it. I was kidding.
I was kidding, really.

288
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,119
- Help me up.
- Help you up? Help me up.

289
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,316
You'll need two hands.

290
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,595
You think you could help me out?

291
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,636
Carla, why won't Turk
let this go?

292
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,154
Marie, she's only with you
for one week.

293
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,993
- Carla...
- Hold on a second.

294
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,799
Bambi, I've got ten messages
from my mother,

295
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,474
my Aunt Marie keeps
calling me about my mother,

296
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,949
I gotta run home
and put out canned cat food

297
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,429
because the dry stuff
doesn't cut it anymore,

298
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,431
plus Turk and I
can't be together

299
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,114
cos I'm working doubles
and he's moonlighting

300
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,237
so we can send my mother
to a decent retirement community.

301
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,312
- So what, Bambi, what?
- We'll talk later.

302
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,995
<i>Carla said something that made</i>
<i>me realize what I had to do.</i>

303
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,992
That's it for me.
I'm gonna get my stuff and leave.

304
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,395
- What are you doing in here?
- She said "we."

305
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,118
- What?
- Carla, she said "we."

306
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,634
"We" need to scrape
some money together.

307
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,280
And it wasn't just like
a "we're dating" we.

308
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,557
It was a "we're gonna spend the
rest of our lives together" we.

309
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,359
I don't know, man.
That just seems big to me.

310
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,749
Yeah, I know.

311
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,469
Can I run the siren?

312
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,994
Yeah, all right. Make it quick.

313
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,114
So you finally stood up
to your father?

314
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,519
Yep.

315
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,716
And he cut you off,
no money, no nothing?

316
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,268
- Pretty much.
- Jerk.

317
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,591
Wow, this is a big place.

318
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,831
Do you know where I could
find some boxes?

319
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,077
So, is your ex-wife like,
"all women are crazy" crazy,

320
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,233
or more like "that assistant
who tasered David Spade" crazy?

321
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,151
You've got to try and understand,

322
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,629
she's going through
a rough time right now,

323
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,711
and she's used to leaning on me,

324
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,678
which in her current condition
is actually causing me

325
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,752
more physical pain
than it is emotional.

326
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,877
But, still,
it sure was silly of her

327
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,236
to try to make me choose
between the two of you.

328
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,993
I guess it was a pretty
easy decision, huh?

329
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,591
Well, when I really had a chance
to think about it,

330
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,275
it turns out it was the easiest
decision I ever made.

331
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,033
I was always going
to wind up with you.

332
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,112
So the whole vulnerable
crying thing worked, huh?

333
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,795
I never had a chance.

334
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,110
You do realize I'm pregnant,
don't you?

335
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,397
Yeah, they're both for me.

336
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,357
Cheers.

337
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,716
You know, I keep waiting
to get sick of pudding,

338
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,631
but with every cup
I love it more.

339
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,994
Me, too.

340
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,316
So, you gonna marry her?

341
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,073
Yeah, I think so.

342
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,429
- I'm sorry I ripped you off.
- Ah, forget it.

343
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,351
You can keep the hundred bucks.

344
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,352
I was gonna, man.

345
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,874
I was gonna.

346
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,679
<i>I usually don't like</i>
<i>thinking about the future.</i>

347
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,152
<i>Let's face it, you can't</i>
<i>predict what's gonna happen.</i>

348
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,269
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>the thing you didn't expect</i>

349
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,920
<i>is what you really wanted</i>
<i>after all.</i>

350
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,798
<i>Maybe the best thing to do</i>
<i>is stop trying to figure out</i>

351
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,394
<i>where you're going</i>
<i>and enjoy where you're at.</i>

352
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,789
All right, now,
who wants a refill?

353
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,919
- I can't afford this place.
- Elliot, I'm $130,000 in debt.

354
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,878
You're gonna be all right.

355
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,354
Come on, let's dance, stud.
