1
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,267
THAT WAS SWEET.
YEAH.

2
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:37,686
WHY DON'T YOU GO
PUT ON A SKIRT,

3
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:39,570
'CAUSE YOU ARE MY BITCH.

4
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,706
I JUST BEAT YOU
3 STRAIGHT GAMES.

5
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,608
YOU MIGHT'VE WON
3 GAMES,

6
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,576
BUT, UH, I HAD
MORE TOTAL POINTS.

7
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:48,279
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

8
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,849
YOU LOST.
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

9
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:58,323
SWEET MARY.

10
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,292
SHOULD I WAIT FOR YOU,
SHOULD I GO HOME?

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,293
WHAT?

12
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:03,694
WH-WHAT'S THE DEAL?

13
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,246
OH, IT'S
A POLE-DANCING CLASS.

14
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:06,865
THEY GOT THEM
ALL OVER THE PLACE NOW.

15
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:08,332
WOW.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,385
GLAD I WORE
MY BAGGY SHORTS.

17
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,595
SOME WILD STUFF, HUH?

18
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,464
SEE THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE?

19
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:23,231
THAT'S MY WIFE.

20
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:25,750
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S LIMBER.

21
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,335
YEAH. SHE'S BEEN DOING IT
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

22
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,703
IT'S A GREAT WORKOUT.

23
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:30,304
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU.

24
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,607
IT'S BEEN A NICE ADDITION TO THE
BEDROOM, KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

25
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,458
WHAT?

26
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,443
YOU-

27
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,512
YOUR WIFE POLE-DANCES
FOR YOU IN YOUR HOME,

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,813
IN YOUR BEDROOM?

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,648
YEAH.

30
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:45,220
DEAC, HIS WIFE POLE-DANCES
FOR HIM IN HIS BEDROOM.

31
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:46,554
DID YOU KNOW
THAT KIND OF THING

32
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:47,822
WAS GOING ON
IN THE WORLD?

33
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:48,807
UH-HUH.

34
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:50,608
WHY, YOU THINK YOU WANT
CARRIE TO DO THAT FOR YOU?

35
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:54,362
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING I
WANT HIS WIFE TO DO IT FOR ME.

36
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:58,666
BUT CARRIE WOULD
BE GOOD, TOO.

37
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,352
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
SUGGEST IT TO HER?

38
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:01,118
I CAN'T DO THAT.

39
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,570
IF SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO DRESS UP AS BATGIRL,

40
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:04,472
SHE AIN'T GONNA WANT
TO DO THIS.

41
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:06,641
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE A LOT OF FUN.

42
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,326
SHE MIGHT GO FOR IT.

43
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,762
WHY, YOU THINK YOU COULD
BRING THIS THING UP TO KELLY?

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,530
I GUESS SO.
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME.

45
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,233
WE GOT PLENTY GOING ON
IN THE BEDROOM AS IT IS.

46
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,822
EVER GET TIRED OF BEING
A RACIAL STEREOTYPE?

47
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,643
NO.

48
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,579
DO YOU?

49
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,752
AND THEN I GOT THE DRAGON
IN ATLANTIC CITY

50
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,520
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

51
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,155
IT'S NICE.

52
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,758
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S PRETTY
MAD AT YOSEMITE SAM.

53
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:42,026
WHAT ABOUT YOU, CARRIE,
YOU HAVE ANY TATS?

54
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:43,194
TATTOOS? NO.

55
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:46,664
I HAVE A JOB, SO...

56
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:50,669
HEY, IT'S REALLY GREAT
YOU GUYS HAD US OVER LIKE THIS.

57
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:54,138
I'M GLAD YOU CHASED US DOWN
IN THE PARKING LOT, DOUG.

58
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:56,591
I JUST HAD AN INSTINCT,
YOU KNOW?

59
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,058
WHAT ELSE YOU GUYS INTO?

60
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:01,061
I KNOW YOU WORK OUT 'CAUSE I
MET YOU AT THE GYM. I MEAN...

61
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,381
YEAH, I DO WEIGHTS,
LIKE, 4 OR 5 TIMES A WEEK-

62
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,448
EXCELLENT!

63
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,051
HOW ABOUT YOU ANNA MARIA?
WHAT DO YOU DO THERE?

64
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,252
UM, TREADMILL.

65
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,654
OH. AND?

66
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,738
STAIRMASTER SOMETIMES.

67
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,373
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT MORE-

68
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,126
ANYTHING ELSE?
ANYTHING ELSE YOU DO THERE?

69
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,879
WELL, I'VE BEEN TAKING
THAT POLE-DANCING CLASS.

70
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,613
THAT'S CRAZY.
POLE-DANCING.

71
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,581
CRAZY WHAT THESE CHICKS
ARE INTO NOWADAYS.

72
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:22,050
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, ED.

73
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,168
WHY DON'T WE LET THE LADIES
TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE.

74
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,804
WE'LL GO GET ANOTHER
BEER IN THE KITCHEN?

75
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,805
OK.

76
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,306
I ALSO TAKE SPINNING
ON TUESDAYS.

77
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,341
THEY JUST GOT
SOME NEW EQUIP-

78
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,177
POLE-DANCING!

79
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:34,145
BYE, THANK YOU.

80
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,847
BYE, GUYS. SEE YA.

81
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,183
HUH? OUR NEW
GO-TO COUPLE.

82
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,217
MM-HMM.

83
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,319
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

84
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,453
WHAT?

85
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,304
DID YOU ACTUALLY THINK
YOU CAN TRICK ME

86
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,924
INTO TAKING
A POLE-DANCING-DUH-

87
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,591
DAT GIRL POLE-DANCES.

88
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,129
ME WANNA POLE-DANCE, TOO.

89
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,813
I WASN'T TRYING
TO TRICK YOU.

90
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:54,482
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
A WAY TO SUGGEST IT.

91
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,285
I FIGURED IF I BROUGHT IT
UP MYSELF, YOU'D GET MAD.

92
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,403
YEAH. I'M MAD NOW.

93
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,639
MAD 'CAUSE I HAD TO
MAKE STEAK FOR IDIOTS.

94
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,607
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
AN OPEN MIND?

95
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,308
A LOT OF WOMEN
ARE POLE-DANCING NOWADAYS.

96
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,877
IT'S A WHOLE THING,
AND WE'RE MISSING IT.

97
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:06,894
<i>NO. I'M
NOT MISSING IT.</i>

98
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:08,162
<i>YOU'RE MISSING IT.</i>

99
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,349
I'M OK NOT GYRATING AROUND
LIKE A 2-DOLLAR WHORE.

100
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,250
TRY IT ONCE.

101
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,068
OHH.

102
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,653
COME ON!

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,756
DOUG, I AM NOT POLE-DANCING
FOR YOU IN OUR BEDROOM.

104
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:20,492
THIS IS SO TYPICAL
OF YOU, TOO.

105
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,093
AS SOON AS THE LIGHTS GO OUT UPSTAIRS,

106
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,627
YOU'RE ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR YOURSELF.

107
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,497
THIS WOULDN'T BE JUST FOR ME.
IT WOULD BE FOR US.

108
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,698
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING HERE. OK?

109
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,933
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

110
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,735
JUST SOME FREE INFORMATION

111
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,103
I GOT AT THE
POLE-DANCING CLASS.

112
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,306
OK, LOOK. ALL THESE WOMEN
TALK ABOUT HOW AT FIRST

113
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,208
THEY WERE SKEPTICAL,
BUT AFTER THEY TRIED IT,

114
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,860
THEY FELT MORE SEXUAL,
MORE EMPOWERED.

115
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,647
HERE, LOOK AT THE SPANISH LADY
HOLDING THE BRIEFCASE.

116
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,983
YO SOY "EMPOWERMENTE."

117
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,019
NOT INTERESTED.

118
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,289
AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK
AT THE VIDEO.

119
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,706
THEY GAVE YOU A VIDEO?

120
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,476
THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME.
IT WAS 29.95.

121
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,511
YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?
YOUR POLE-DANCING FANTASY

122
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,014
IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN, OK?
SO JUST GIVE IT UP.

123
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,119
WELL, WE'RE ALREADY
ON THE MAILING LIST.

124
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,720
WHAT THE HELL IS
KATIE COURIC UP TO NOW?

125
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:57,788
HEY, DAD.

126
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,557
DIDN'T HEAR YOU
BACK THERE.

127
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:03,360
OH, IT'S A TAPE.
WHAT IS IT?

128
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:07,281
UH, JUST AN INSTRUCTIONAL
VIDEO FROM A CLASS I MAY TAKE.

129
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,683
WELL, I'M LATE FOR WORK.

130
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,801
LOVE YA. BYE-BYE.

131
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:18,776
"POLE CATS. THE EROTIC
ART OF POLE-DANCING."

132
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,746
OH, DEAR GOD.

133
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,452
COME ON.
WHEN'S IT GETTING HERE?

134
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,153
SIT DOWN, WILL YA?
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW

135
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,589
IS NOT GONNA MAKE THE
POLE GET HERE ANY FASTER.

136
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,990
IT'S ALMOST 5:00.

137
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,693
EXPRESS MAIL GUARANTEED
DELIVERY BEFORE 5:00.

138
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,912
EXPRESS MAIL?
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE US?

139
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,214
US? WE SUCK.

140
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,433
I CAN'T BELIEVE
CARRIE WENT FOR IT.

141
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,103
SHE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THE PLEASING YOU TYPE.

142
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,071
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO DO IT AT FIRST,

143
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,440
BUT AFTER SHE TRIED IT FOR A COUPLE
OF WEEKS, SHE REALLY LOVES IT.

144
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:52,376
SHE SAYS IT GETS HER IN TOUCH
WITH HER INNER WHORE. IT'S NICE.

145
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,980
AND THE RICH GET RICHER.

146
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,482
OH, MAN, I WANT
THIS THING TO COME QUICK.

147
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,584
YOU KNOW, I AM READY
FOR MY FIRST DANCE.

148
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,919
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING? READY.

149
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:02,954
UH-HUH.

150
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,505
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

151
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,740
LOOK WHAT SHE MADE
FOR ME. COUPONS.

152
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:13,198
"GOOD FOR ONE FREE POLE
DANCE FROM MISTY HEFFERNAN."

153
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:17,969
DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE AN AUNT
NAMED MISTY HEFFERNAN?

154
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,087
YEAH. SHE JUST HAD
HIP SURGERY.

155
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:22,056
GOOD LADY.

156
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:25,776
GUESS WHO'S HERE.
THE POLE FAIRY.

157
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:28,512
SOMEONE JUST BOUGHT HIMSELF
A NEW NICKNAME.

158
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,381
COME ON, GUYS,
GIVE ME A HAND.

159
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:34,935
HEY, ARTHUR.
I'M GONNA MAKE A SANDWICH.

160
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:35,736
YOU WANT ONE?

161
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,321
NOPE.
YOU SURE?

162
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,924
A MAN WHO TURNS HIS OWN
DAUGHTER INTO AN EXOTIC DANCER

163
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,560
DOES NOT DESERVE TO EAT.

164
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,196
THEY'VE GOT FRESH
CORNED BEEF.

165
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,364
NO!

166
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,002
WELL, THERE IT GOES.

167
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,354
A 10-FOOT ARROW
THROUGH MY HEART.

168
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:58,692
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,844
DAMN IT, MAN,
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

170
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,313
WHEN A CHILD DOESN'T GET
ENOUGH LOVE AND AFFECTION

171
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,564
FROM HER OWN FATHER,

172
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:05,699
SHE SEEKS IT
FROM STRANGE MEN.

173
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,401
THAT'S WHY CARRIE'S
DOING THIS.

174
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,203
BECAUSE I SPENT
HER CHILDHOOD

175
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:12,039
CHASING AFTER
THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR.

176
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,307
HOW'D THAT WORK OUT
FOR YOU?

177
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,145
LOOK, ARTHUR, YOU'RE GETTING
WORKED UP OVER NOTHING.

178
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,013
SHE'S JUST GONNA
DANCE FOR DOUG.

179
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,330
OH, SURE, THAT'S
HOW IT STARTS.

180
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:23,467
THEN IT'S PEEP SHOWS,
STRIP JOINTS,

181
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:26,370
AND BEFORE LONG, SHE'S AT THE
PORT AUTHORITY IN HOT PANTS,

182
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:30,908
BECKONING DRUNKEN MARINES INTO
THE BACK OF AN ABANDONED BUS.

183
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:31,876
WHAT'S THAT?

184
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,094
PUMPERNICKEL?

185
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:35,396
CUT ME OFF HALF.

186
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,285
DOUG.

187
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,554
YEAH?

188
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,339
MISTY IS READY.

189
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,327
DON'T
FORGET THE COUPON.

190
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,571
M- MISTY?

191
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,640
I'M IN THE BATHROOM.

192
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,643
TURN ON THE MUSIC AND
SETTLE IN, BIG BOY.

193
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,445
YEAH.

194
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,584
<i>THE PELICAN BRIEF,
BY JOHN GRISHAM.</i>

195
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:16,754
THE CD!
NOT THE TAPE!

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,633
HEY. SO...

197
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,968
HOW WAS
OPENING NIGHT?

198
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,705
OH. THE POLE-DANCING.

199
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,339
IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS GOOD.

200
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:43,507
ALL RIGHT.

201
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,808
SO, YOU...

202
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:46,244
IT WAS HOT?

203
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:46,994
SIZZLIN'.

204
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,412
OHH.

205
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,580
SHE, UH...

206
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,849
SHE REALLY...

207
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,317
REALLY...

208
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:56,087
SHOULDN'T BE POLE-DANCING.

209
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,822
OH, REALLY?
THAT'S TOO BAD.

210
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,291
NO GOOD?

211
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,777
NO.

212
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:04,078
AWW.

213
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:06,313
SHE TRIED,
GOD BLESS HER.

214
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,882
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SHE WAS
DOING EVERYTHING THEY TAUGHT HER

215
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,251
AND GOING THROUGH
THE MOVES.

216
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:13,687
I DEFINITELY GOT A SENSE OF
WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

217
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:16,557
MAKES YOU REALLY
APPRECIATE THE PROS, HUH?

218
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,276
OH, YOU SAID IT, BROTHER.

219
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,026
ALL RIGHT,
SO IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

220
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:20,578
JUST GET RID OF THE POLE
AND MOVE ON.

221
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,246
I CAN'T. I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT HER INTO IT,

222
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,514
AND NOW SHE'S HOOKED.

223
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,017
SHE'S THINKING OF MAKING
IT AN EVERY-NIGHT THING,

224
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,485
AND SHE'S EVEN TALKING
ABOUT PUTTING IN A SPOTLIGHT.

225
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,324
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
DEAC,

226
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,226
YOU WERE SMART FOR NOT
GETTING KELLY INVOLVED.

227
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,962
UH, YEAH. AHEM.

228
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,599
WHAT?

229
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,550
IT'S JUST...

230
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,785
AFTER THAT DAY AT THE GYM,
I ACTUALLY DID

231
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:48,372
KIND OF SUGGEST IT TO KELLY, AND
SHE'S BEEN DOING IT SINCE THEN.

232
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,306
REALLY?

233
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,941
HOW IS SHE?

234
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,543
SHE'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

235
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,565
GOOD MORNING.

236
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,001
HEY.
HONEY.

237
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:03,704
SO LAST NIGHT WAS...

238
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:04,955
OK?

239
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:07,091
YEAH. MM-HMM.
YEAH. UH-HUH.

240
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,492
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

241
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,395
<i>YO SOY "EMPOWERMENTE."</i>

242
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,701
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
BEFORE I FORGET,

243
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,004
I GOT ANOTHER COUPON
FOR YOU.

244
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,339
OH, THAT'S OK.
I REALLY HAVE SOME-

245
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,740
TAKE IT. OK, OK, YEAH,
YEAH. I'LL TAKE IT.

246
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,617
OK, UH,
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

247
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,019
DEAC, COME ON. YEAH, YEAH. BYE, CARRIE.

248
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:36,520
ALL RIGHT,
BYE, YOU GUYS.

249
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,189
BYE, DEAC.
SEE YOU LATER.

250
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,626
DARLING, I REALIZE
I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVING YOU

251
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:44,795
THE TIME AND ATTENTION
YOU DESERVE.

252
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:46,497
ARE YOU FREE
THIS SATURDAY AFTERNOON?

253
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,866
UM
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST SAY YES!

254
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,668
YES.

255
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,454
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

256
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:55,155
DADDY'S HERE.

257
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,545
MAKE IT STOP!

258
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,485
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

259
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,819
YOUR SHIFT WAS OVER
4 HOURS AGO.

260
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,389
YEAH, I KNOW. JUST CLEANING
OUT THE OLD LOCKER. HEH.

261
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,573
YOU KNOW MY MOTTO.

262
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,209
A MESSY LOCKER'S
THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND.

263
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:25,095
I THOUGHT YOUR MOTTO WAS
"EAT THROUGH THE PAIN."

264
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,997
GUY CAN'T HAVE
2 MOTTOES?

265
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,465
LISTEN TO ME, PLAYER.

266
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,786
GO HOME.

267
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,472
I CAN'T.

268
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:38,309
SHE'S THERE LIMBERING UP AS WE SPEAK.

269
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,843
I CAN'T SIT
IN THAT CHAIR AGAIN.

270
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,711
YOU CAN'T LIVE
LIKE THIS, MAN.

271
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,013
DEAC, SHE GAVE ME
MORE COUPONS.

272
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,749
50, DAMN IT!
50 COUPONS!

273
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:48,685
I USED TO-I USED TO
LOVE POLE-DANCING.

274
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,354
I USED TO LOVE COUPONS.

275
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,823
I GOT AN ARBY'S COUPON IN MY
WALLET FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS.

276
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,524
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT!

277
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,214
IT'S TIME NOW.

278
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:06,286
NOTHING'S WORKED, SPENCE.

279
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:10,224
I'VE SHOWERED HER WITH FATHERLY
AFFECTION FOR 2 ENTIRE WEEKS,

280
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,925
BUT STILL SHE GOES
BACK UP THERE EVERY NIGHT

281
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:13,810
AND GETS HER FREAK ON
FOR FATTY.

282
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:17,964
SO, WHERE DO YOU
WANNA GET DINNER?

283
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,401
OH, CAN I TALK YOU
INTO ETHIOPIAN?

284
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:23,037
NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR GAZELLE, THANK YOU.

285
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,440
HEY, LOOK!

286
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,275
THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.
WHAT?

287
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:30,043
I'LL GET ONE OF THE STRIPPERS
TO COME HOME

288
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,946
AND TELL CARRIE WHAT LIFE
ON THE POLE IS REALLY LIKE,

289
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:35,482
EVERY DEPRAVED
AND PATHETIC DETAIL.

290
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,651
SHE'LL BE SCARED STRAIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

291
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,420
SOUNDS PRETTY STUPID.

292
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:40,821
COME ON.

293
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:45,492
DOESN'T LOOK CLEAN
IN THERE.

294
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,970
PLEASE BE ASLEEP.

295
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,643
DOUG.

296
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:06,213
YEAH.

297
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,215
YOU'RE LAAATE.

298
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,350
NOT LATE ENOUGH.

299
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:36,877
WELCOME
TO THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM.

300
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,762
COME IN.

301
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:48,756
WHY'D YOU
TURN IT OFF?

302
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:49,890
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT WE'D, UH,

303
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,391
CHANGE IT UP
A LITTLE TONIGHT.

304
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:53,744
OH, YEAH? OK, HOW ABOUT
SOME DIFFERENT MUSIC?

305
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,146
<i>HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
HOT FOR TEACHER?</i>

306
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,214
HEH HEH HEH.

307
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,883
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. UH...

308
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,518
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I'D DO SOMETHING FOR YOU, YOU KNOW.

309
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,088
YOU WANT A MASSAGE?
HOW ABOUT A SEXY MASSAGE?

310
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,257
OH. YEAH.
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

311
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:06,990
ALL RIGHT.

312
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,074
HEH HEH HEH.

313
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:09,075
THERE WE GO.

314
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,111
ALL RIGHT.

315
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:12,712
MM-HMM.

316
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,114
OH, THAT'S NICE.

317
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:15,449
OH, IT IS, RIGHT?

318
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:18,251
SO RELAXING I COULD
JUST FALL ASLEEP.

319
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:23,590
JUST GO AHEAD THEN
THERE, MISTY.

320
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,909
MM-MMM. MISTY DOESN'T
WANT TO SLEEP.

321
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:28,945
SHE HAS A NEW DANCE
FOR HER MAN TONIGHT.

322
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,648
THAT'S OK. SLEEP.

323
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:32,883
SLEEP, MISTY.

324
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,951
MM-MMM.

325
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,903
FIRST, A DANCE.

326
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,820
NO, YOU SLEEP. SLEEP.

327
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,171
DOUG, GET OFF!

328
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,907
OK.

329
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,275
JUST THOUGHT MISTY
COULD USE A LITTLE SLEEP.

330
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:45,379
I KNOW, BUT THERE'LL BE
ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT LATER.

331
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:11,338
STOP IT!

332
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,874
WHAT? WHY'D YOU TURN
THE MUSIC OFF, BABY?

333
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,409
IT WAS EITHER THAT
OR DIVE OUT THE WINDOW.

334
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:16,576
CARRIE...

335
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:18,311
CARRIE,
YOU'RE HORRIBLE AT THIS.

336
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,098
WHAT, YOU THINK I'M
HORRIBLE AT THIS?

337
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,115
NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT HORRIBLE.

338
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:24,235
THAT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR.
BUT YOU'RE...

339
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:26,237
NO, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE HORRIBLE.

340
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,772
WHAT, SO FOR
THE LAST 2 WEEKS,

341
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,141
YOU'VE JUST BEEN
PRETENDING TO LIKE IT?

342
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,259
KIND OF, YEAH.

343
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:34,945
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

344
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,113
CARRIE, SO WHAT?

345
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,315
THIS STUPID POLE THING
DIDN'T WORK OUT. WHO CARES?

346
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,818
I STILL THINK YOU'RE THE
SEXIEST WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

347
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,553
I MEAN,
WE HAVE EACH OTHER,

348
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,588
AND THAT'S THE ONLY
DAMN THING THAT MATTERS.

349
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,173
OHH!

350
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:49,293
YOU'RE AN ASS.

351
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,978
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA IN THE
FIRST PLACE, YOU KNOW. I KNOW.

352
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,246
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I SUCK AT IT?

353
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,716
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
HOW HUMILIATING THIS IS?

354
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:58,602
I KNOW. WE'VE BOTH GONE
THROUGH HELL THESE PAST 2 WEEKS.

355
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,304
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?

356
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,222
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

357
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,958
BECAUSE MY INSTRUCTOR SAID I AM
VERY, VERY TALENTED AT THIS.

358
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:06,193
YEAH. THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE PAYING HER.

359
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:10,064
NO, NO. I'M DOING THE MOVES
EXACTLY LIKE SHE TAUGHT US.

360
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:11,815
OK, YOU MIGHT BE DOING THEM
RIGHT TECHNICALLY, BUT YOU-

361
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:12,883
YOU'RE JUST NOT...

362
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,818
NOT WHAT?

363
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:17,120
LOOK, YOU...

364
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,689
YOU'RE NOT
FEELING IT, OK?

365
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:21,758
YOU'RE NOT LIVING IT.

366
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,727
LIKE THAT SPIN-KICK MOVE
YOU DO...

367
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:24,595
YEAH.

368
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,629
YOU...

369
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,381
L- LET ME JUST SHOW YOU.

370
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:37,157
YOU NEED TO BECOME ONE
WITH THE POLE, YOU KNOW?

371
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:40,126
JUST FEEL IT. JUST
FEEL IT. JUST HAVE FUN.

372
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:42,946
'CAUSE YOU GOTTA FEEL IT.
FEEL IT EVERY TIME.

373
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:44,464
YOU GOTTA BECOME ONE-
AND JUST ENJOY IT.

374
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:46,166
ENJOY WHO YOU ARE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

375
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:47,234
UH-HUH.

376
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,930
OH, AND THAT UPSIDE-DOWN MOVE
YOU DO WHEN YOU GET UP THERE,

377
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,149
YOU'RE HERE.

378
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,267
YOU GOTTA BE HERE
LIKE THIS.

379
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,237
AND WHEN YOU SLIDE DOWN,

380
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,605
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

381
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,440
WHEN YOU'RE COMING DOWN,
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

382
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,709
I'M AN ANGEL, OK?

383
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:16,180
AND THIS-
AND THIS HERE.

384
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,570
OK?

385
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:27,891
JUST FEEL IT.

386
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:28,942
LET IT-FEEL IT.

387
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,410
WORK IT...

388
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:32,212
AND BECOME IT.

389
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:47,995
CARRIE.

390
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:49,730
WE SHOULD PROBABLY SHUT
THE DOOR. YOUR FATHER.

391
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,832
NO. MY DAD'S NOT HOME.

392
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:58,221
I STILL HAVEN'T
HAD DINNER.

393
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,490
SHUT UP
AND GET MORE SINGLES.

394
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:12,502
NICE TO SPEND TIME
TOGETHER, HUH?

395
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,237
I'M NOT GONNA STOP
POLE-DANCING, ARTHUR.

396
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,540
FINE!
THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY!
