00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,344
(narrator)
When force to think
outside the box...

00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,979
(Gordon)
That's the water in there.

Veronica...

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,349
Three compartments of it
has been filled up with puke.

And Jesse...

00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,584

Into a TV disaster.

We are all here to celebrate

Can the top 14 rise

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,068
- Perfect.
- Whoo!

Oh [bleep].

Go up in smoke?

22

(Gordon)
It's a celebration.

23
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,176
Not a cremation.

There's vineyards.

00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,100
Whatever we're doing,
I'm gonna enjoy.

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,303
It's gonna be a wonderful
experience.

I'm a California girl
through and through.

34
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,677
It's so refreshing
to be outdoors,

35
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,079
but I know
that it's kind of, like,

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,982
the silence before the storm.

37
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:27,120
Welcome to your next
big team challenge.

38

And guess who will be
making all the food

43
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,071
for this incredible celebration?

45
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,107
That's right.
You will be

00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:59,453
I've been watching <i>MasterChef</i>
since it started.

51
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,222
And it's kind of nice to be
part of history.

52
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,391

in our industry.

57
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,303
Now, for this incredible
occasion,

58
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,073
we want to see one amazing
appetizer

59
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,076
and one stunning entree
from each team.

60
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,980
For your appetizer,
we want each team to make a dish

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,282
featuring these beauties.

62
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,585
- [cheering]
- Exquisite Malpeque oysters

63
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:35,255

Royal Ossetra caviar.

64
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,658
- Whoo!
- Now, we also want you to make

65
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,695
a elegant entree starring this.

A phenomenal duck breast.

68

Your food must rise
to the occasion.

69

(all)
Yes, Chef.

00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,974
Nick and Olivia,
you had the winning dishes

71
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:59,312
in the previous challenge, so
you will become team captains.

History in the making.

73

There is nothing
more important

74
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,218
than winning
this team challenge.

75
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,054
Now, Nick, since you had
the winning dish,

76
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,089
you get to pick first.

77
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,159
First person I'm gonna pick
is probably the hardest worker

78
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,494
in the kitchen.

79
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,562
Amanda.

00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,563

as the best contestant here,

picks me first,
and I am absolutely honored,

84
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,640
and I feel so good.

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,008
Okay, Olivia, next.

86
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,011
The reason I'm going to
choose this person is because

87
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:35,048
I think they have demonstrated
a lot of technique.

88
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,216
Derrick.

89
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,051
(Gordon)
Excellent.
Derrick, come up.

90
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,053
My worry with Olivia is

91
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,988
I don't think she's confident
enough in herself

92
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,290
to be a team captain.

93
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,325
We've been on a winning team
together twice

94
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,594
and we're gonna make it
a third time with Stephen.

95

00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,230

Chris.

99
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,202
I'm picking Charlie.

100
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,370
- I'm gonna choose Hetal.
- Hetal, welcome.

101
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,006
- I'm taking Shelly.
- Shelly. Good.

102
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,074
I'm gonna choose Kerry.

00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,315
Tommy, Claudia,
final pick.

105
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,549
How do you feel?

106
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,618
It feels like being
in grade school again,

107
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,654
when I'd be the last one to get
picked for the softball team.

108
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,423
I've worked with Nick before,

109
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,092
and we've both worked
together seamlessly,

110
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,129
and I'm hoping that Nick
is gonna pick me.

111
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,163
I wanna win.

112
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,331
So I'm picking the best person

113
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,599

fit with my team.

It's gonna be Claudia.

I'm worried about
having Tommy on my team.

122

He does stupid things
under pressure.

123
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,350
He overcomplicates

124
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,585
and he's not the greatest at
working as a team.

125
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,388
Right. Red Team, Blue Team,
you have just 60 minutes

126
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,358
before you'll be serving
that stunning oyster and caviar

Yes, Chef.

The pressure is on.

135

With the pantry stocked
full of the finest ingredients,

136
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:14,114
it is now up to our home cooks
to devise and execute a menu

137
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:19,119
worthy of the <i>MasterChef</i>
100th episode celebration.

138
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,121
What I'm thinking
is a poached oyster.

139
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,022
- Yeah.
- In white wine and butter.

140
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,023
- I like it.
- We're gonna sit it

141
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,991
on top of a pickled slaw.

142
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:29,429
I make a salsa with, like,
jalapeño, apple, and kumquats.

143
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,131
- And I saw kumquats back there.
- Cool, instead of kumquats,

144
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,232
- put cucumbers.
- Okay. Put cucumbers. Love it.

145
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,300
We'll put you in charge of that.

146
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,267
You want to make
a little crème fraiche?

147
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,036
Mix the caviar inside.

148
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,537
It's gonna go good
with the apple salad.

149
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,105
- It will have it already--
- I like the crème fraiche.

150
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,007
You know, I'm feeling really
good about this menu.

151
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,043
It's a great collaboration
with Nick.

152
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,979
Okay, for the duck, I'm thinking
a Moroccan type of spiced duck.

153
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,547
And then candied carrots.

154
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,548
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

155
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,150
- Good?
- Okay. Let's go.

quickly agrees on

Captain Olivia has more
ambitious plans in mind.

159
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,026
We're gonna
smoke the oyster.

160
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,394
We can fry this oyster
and make it really good.

161
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,996
It fries super quick.
I think it's the fastest way

162
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,231
- to go with the oyster.
- I wanna smoke the oyster.

163

They're gonna do
something expected.

If I may recommend,
shaved cucumber

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,168
'cause it's bright and light.

166
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,603

Done, but I want
a citrus in there.

167
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,604
Use a vinaigrette?

00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,472
(Olivia)
Yes, perfect.

169
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,074
I have another challenge today:

working with Olivia.

171
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,610
And she's coming up
with the menu.

172
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,979
[mocking Olivia]
It's like so many components.

173
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,515
We're gonna do duck basted
in orange and fresh ginger.

174
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,751
When that comes out,
you supreme the orange,

175
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,555
add the orange, and then
we're gonna toast pistachios.

which team performed the best,

348
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,673
and which team will have to
face the pressure test.

349
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,175
So, this is probably
the table

350
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,743
everyone was most nervous
to cook for.

351
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,011
[laughter]

352
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,279
Tell me what we thought about

353
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,615
the Blue Team's oyster course.

354
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,050
I think that they were creative
with the plating.

355
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,318
It was colorful.

356
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,686
I don't think
the caviar should've been

357
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,054
sitting on the plate.

358
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,257
I wish it were on top of
the actual dish itself.

359
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,659
I think my plate
explains it all.

360
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,527
Blue Team's oysters
were delicious.

361
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,563
All right.
Thank you, guys.

362
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,031
I loved the concept of the dish

363
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,433
with a lot of
contrasting flavors.

364
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,668
But I would have loved
to have

365
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,503
more oysters and caviar
on the dish.

366
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,505
Service, please.
Last table for appetizers.

367
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,741
- Olivia, two seconds.
- Yeah?

368
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,742
Yes, Chef.

369
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,543
So that was terrible.

370
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,178
- Okay? That wasn't good.
- Okay.

371
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,713
(Gordon)
The problem is,
there's no organization.

372
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,715
You need to be in control
of your brigade.

373
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,751
I know, but Derrick seems to
think that I can't handle it,

374
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,752
so he's just [bleep] me off,

375
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,687
which is really
becoming a problem.

376
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,055
Well...put him in his place.

377
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,056
Okay.

00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,257
- You're the captain.
- Okay.

379
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,358
So, at the end of the day,

380
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,093
this is riding on
your shoulders.

381
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,428
- I'm sorry, that's just it.
- No, you're right.

382
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,031
You've got a whole other course
to claw this back.

383
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,065
- You're right.
- Okay?

384
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,300
Get a meeting,
get your team together,

385
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,734
and they do as you say.

386
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,002
- Okay.
- Period.

387
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,203
- You're right. Yeah.
- Got it?

388
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,571
- Thank you. Thank you.

cut the duck
and put it on a plate.
