1
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:37,152
HERE YOU GO.

2
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,936
OH, THANKS.

3
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,276
I THINK SOMEBODY'S
INTO ME.

4
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,711
WHAT?

5
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,613
LOOK WHAT SHE GAVE ME.
SHE GAVE ME PRETZELS.

6
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,648
LOOK AT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
HAS-PEANUTS.

7
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:51,983
SO?

8
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,184
SO I WAS IN HERE
THE OTHER DAY.

9
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:55,353
I TOLD HER I WAS
ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS.

10
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,155
AND SIENNA
REMEMBERED.

11
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:58,590
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S
INTO YOU, ALL RIGHT?

12
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:01,226
IT MEANS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE
TO OPEN YOUR THROAT WITH A PEN.

13
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:04,462
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST FACE IT, DANNY.

14
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,433
THE "PRETTY LADY" BUS HAS
JUST PULLED IN TO SPENCEVILLE.

15
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,202
COME ON, YOU GOT
TO CHOOSE.

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,637
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

17
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,238
UM, I GUESS I'D
RATHER HAVE

18
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,007
MY FEET CUT OFF.

19
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,859
SO YOU'RE GONNA GO NO FEET
INSTEAD OF NO HANDS.

20
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,528
ALL RIGHT. HOW ARE
YOU GONNA WALK?

21
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:21,730
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. YOU
SAID I HAD TO PICK ONE.

22
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:23,281
I KNOW. BUT THE OBVIOUS
CHOICE IS HANDS.

23
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,817
I MEAN, YOU NEED FEET
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND.

24
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:29,036
YOU HAVE FEET AND YOU
DON'T MOVE AROUND.

25
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:34,459
THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR TRYING TO
HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

26
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,310
WE'D BETTER GET GOING OR
WE'LL BE LATE FOR THE MOVIE.

27
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:37,712
OH, I'M NOT GONNA BE LATE
BECAUSE I GOT FEET.

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,681
GOOD LUCK GETTING THERE
ON YOUR ANKLE NUBS, YEAH.

29
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:41,850
YOU ALL SET?

30
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:43,118
UH, YEP.

31
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:46,454
AND THIS IS FOR YOU.

32
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:47,588
OH, THANKS.

33
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:49,657
LET ME GET YOU
SOME CHANGE.

34
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,442
OH, NO SWEAT. KEEP IT.

35
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,078
HEY! THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,097
HOW MUCH DID YOU
GIVE HER?

37
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:57,498
I DON'T KNOW.
FIVE BUCKS.

38
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,833
FIVE?!

39
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,167
I ONLY GAVE HER TWO,

40
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,736
AND OUR CHECKS WERE
EXACTLY THE SAME.

41
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:04,155
HEY, MAN, I USED
TO BE A WAITER, ALL RIGHT?

42
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:07,591
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO SERVE IDIOTS LIKE YOU.

43
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,277
YOU MADE ME LOOK BAD
IN FRONT OF SIENNA.

44
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:13,264
NO. I THINK THE THING HANGING OUT
OF YOUR NOSE BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH.

45
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,438
THE MOVIE REALLY
GOT ME THINKING.

46
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:23,441
I MEAN, WHY AREN'T THERE PEOPLE
LIVING ON MERCURY RIGHT NOW?

47
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,076
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
IT'S 800 DEGREES.

48
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:27,078
WE'D BURN UP IN,
LIKE, TWO SECONDS.

49
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:28,646
NO. IF WE'RE WEARING,
LIKE, SPECIAL SUITS,

50
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,081
LIKE NICK NOLTE
AND MARTIN LAWRENCE.

51
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:33,884
P.S., THEY'D BE GREAT IN
"THE DOUG AND DEACON STORY."

52
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:36,170
OH. I GOT TWO MESSAGES.

53
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,639
IT'S ME. LISTEN,
REAL QUICK,

54
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:39,307
THERE'S A PIE
IN THE FRIDGE.

55
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,808
IT'S FOR
MY BOOK CLUB.

56
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,477
PLEASE DON'T
TOUCH IT.

57
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:43,578
DOUG...

58
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,113
PLEASE. BYE.

59
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,633
WE'LL SEE.

60
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,834
HI.

61
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:52,136
I HOPE THIS IS THE DOUG HEFFERNAN

62
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,073
I MET IN THE HAMPTONS. IT'S JESSICA.

63
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,875
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT LAST WEEKEND.

64
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:01,496
HOW GOOD
YOU SMELLED,

65
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:05,667
HOW YOUR
LIPS TASTED,

66
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,835
ABOUT WHAT WE DID ON THE BEACH.

67
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:12,273
ANYWAY, YOU GOT MY
NUMBER. GIVE ME A CALL.

68
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,663
TALK TO ME, PLAYER.

69
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,753
IS IT POSSIBLE
I BLACKED OUT...

70
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:28,690
WENT TO THE HAMPTONS...

71
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:34,428
AND LET A VERY HOT
GIRL TASTE ME?

72
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,349
I'M GUESSING NO, BUT WHAT
WAS THAT ABOUT? DAMN!

73
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,550
I DON'T KNOW.

74
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,019
I GUESS THERE'S ANOTHER DOUG HEFFERNAN.

75
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,354
SHE PROBABLY GOT MY NUMBER BY MISTAKE.

76
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,606
I GOT TO ERASE THAT, THOUGH.
CARRIE CAN'T HEAR THAT.

77
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:47,441
WHAT FOR? YOU
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

78
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,660
NO. TRUST ME. SHE'S GOT
QUITE A JEALOUS STREAK GOING.

79
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,029
IF SHE HEARS THAT...

80
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:52,630
OK, OK.

81
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:54,199
I'M SERIOUS, MAN. ONCE
I WAS IN A SUPERMARKET

82
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,033
AND ANOTHER GIRL
JUST LOOKED AT ME.

83
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,403
CARRIE BEAT HER
WITH A CANTALOUPE.

84
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,138
SO I NEVER GOT THIS MESSAGE,

85
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,307
AND I NEVER GOT
THE ONE ABOUT THE PIE.

86
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:03,641
LET'S GO.

87
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:14,402
YELLO.

88
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,403
DOUG?

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,404
YEAH.

90
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,940
HI. IT'S JESSICA
FROM THE HAMPTONS.

91
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,025
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER ME.

92
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,395
UH, YEAH. ACTUALLY,
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

93
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:24,729
YOU ARE?

94
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,665
YEAH. LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WAS NOT ME WHO WAS WITH-

95
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,049
HEY, WHO'S THAT?

96
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:29,433
UH, MY MOM.

97
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,035
OH! GOOD. I NEED TO GET
HER CREDIT CARD NUMBER

98
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,870
IF SHE STILL WANTS
THOSE THEATER TICKETS.

99
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:34,405
OK, YEAH. NO, I'LL-
I'LL TELL HER.

100
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,774
I GOT IT. EXCUSE ME.

101
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,659
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

102
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:42,013
THAT'S OK, SEXY. YOU'RE
WORTH WAITING FOR.

103
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,082
LISTEN, I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW, I'M NOT THE GUY WHO YOU-

104
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,750
YOUR VOICE SOUNDS
DEEPER ON THE PHONE.

105
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,585
REALLY? BECAUSE I'M JUST
TALKING, YOU KNOW, NORMALLY.

106
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:48,953
I MEAN.

107
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,588
HEY. DID YOU GET
THE CREDIT CARD NUMBER?

108
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,406
OH, NO, I DIDN'T. I CAN'T
GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE.

109
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:55,426
YOU KNOW MY MOM.
SHE'S SO CRAZY.

110
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:58,379
LISTEN, IT SOUNDS LIKE I
CAUGHT YOU AT A BAD TIME.

111
00:04:58,447 --> 00:04:59,713
I- I'LL JUST CALL
BACK LATER.

112
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:00,931
NO, NO, NO. NO,
NO. IT'S FINE.

113
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:05,303
NO? YOU MEAN NO LIKE
YOU SAID ON THE BEACH?

114
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,039
MM!

115
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,607
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST TELL
HER THAT I'LL PUT THE TICKETS

116
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,876
ON MY CREDIT CARD.
OH, OK.

117
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,112
OK. I-I'LL DO IT.

118
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:20,285
YOU HAVE A GREAT
NIGHT, SEXY. LOVE YOU.

119
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,552
OK. LOVE YOU,
TOO. OK.

120
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,222
MOM, MOM, MOM.

121
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,465
HELLO.

122
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,817
HELLO?

123
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,621
THAT'S THE THIRD HANG UP
THIS MORNING.

124
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:41,656
REALLY?

125
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:43,074
YEAH. TWICE WHILE
YOU WERE IN THE SHOWER.

126
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,625
LISTEN, TELL YOUR
GIRLFRIENDS TO AT LEAST WAIT

127
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:46,227
UNTIL I'VE GONE TO WORK.

128
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:48,780
HEY, CAR.

129
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,147
HAVE A GOOD ONE.
ALL RIGHT.

130
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,518
SHE CALLED AGAIN.

131
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,054
WHO?

132
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,556
JESSICA. SHE HUNG UP ON
CARRIE 3 TIMES THIS MORNING.

133
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,958
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
FOR SURE IT WAS HER?

134
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,927
TRUST ME. IT'S HER.
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

135
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,778
YOU MEAN, WITH THE OTHER
DOUG HEFFERNAN.

136
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:07,748
NO. WITH ME, TOO. OK,
SHE CALLED LAST NIGHT,

137
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,517
AND, WELL,
WE TALKED.

138
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:10,951
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
HER YOU WEREN'T THE SAME GUY?

139
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,187
I TRIED, BUT CARRIE WAS
STANDING RIGHT THERE.

140
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:16,357
WELL, SO NOW SHE THINKS YOU ARE
THE DOUG HEFFERNAN SHE SLEPT WITH?

141
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:20,929
YES. AND I MAY HAVE
TOLD HER I LOVE HER.

142
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:25,066
WOW. YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE
WHO DID NOTHING WRONG,

143
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,801
YOU'VE DUG YOURSELF
QUITE A HOLE HERE.

144
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:30,804
OH, GOOD. I HOPE
THAT'S HER.

145
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,807
HELLO.

146
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,042
HI, SEXY.

147
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,993
JESSICA. IT'S JESSICA.

148
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,295
YEAH, YEAH.
I GOT THAT.

149
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,866
HEY, UH, I'M-I'M
GLAD YOU CALLED.

150
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,869
UM, LOOK, THIS WHOLE THING
KIND OF GOT OUT OF CONTROL HERE,

151
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,472
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE, I'M NOT
THE SAME PERSON YOU WERE WITH

152
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,673
IN THE HAMPTONS.

153
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,842
THAT NIGHT
CHANGED ME, TOO.

154
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,662
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

155
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,432
IT'S NOT ME. I DON'T-
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

156
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,116
WHAT? WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, DOUG?

157
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,820
LAST NIGHT YOU TELL
ME YOU LOVE ME,

158
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,556
AND THEN THIS MORNING SOME
STRANGE WOMAN ANSWERS YOUR PHONE

159
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,592
AND SUDDENLY YOU
DON'T KNOW ME?

160
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,226
YES. SO WE'RE GOOD?

161
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:13,881
LOOK, DOUG,
DON'T PLAY GAMES.

162
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:16,367
IF THIS WAS ONLY A ONE-NIGHT
THING FOR YOU, JUST SAY SO

163
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,902
AND YOU'LL NEVER HEAR
FROM ME AGAIN.

164
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,103
NO, IT'S NOT THAT-

165
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,305
JUST SAY IT!

166
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:23,641
IT WAS A ONE-NIGHT
THING FOR ME.

167
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,412
OH, GOD. I KNEW
IT, I KNEW IT!

168
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,980
OH, HEY, COME ON.
DON'T CRY. COME ON.

169
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:33,484
NO! LOOK, IT'S NOT YOU.

170
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,420
IT'S-IT'S-IT'S ME.

171
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,621
WHAT?

172
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,341
YEAH, RIGHT.

173
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,677
LOOK, YOU'RE
AN AWESOME PERSON,

174
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:49,550
AND ONE DAY, YOU'RE GONNA FIND
SOMEONE JUST AS GOOD AS ME.

175
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,675
WELL, I GUESS I'M LUCKY TO HAVE
HAD AT LEAST ONE NIGHT WITH YOU.

176
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,612
NO, JESSICA,
WE'RE BOTH LUCKY.

177
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,416
NOW, YOU GO HAVE
YOURSELF A GREAT LIFE.

178
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,719
BYE.

179
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,624
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

180
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,735
4- BALL, SIDE POCKET.

181
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:29,273
YEP. YOU GOT TO BE HAPPY
WITH WHAT YOU GOT, DEAC.

182
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,909
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

183
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:34,612
KELLY. LOVE
YOUR WIFE, MAN.

184
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,864
I DO LOVE MY WIFE.

185
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:39,500
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
YOU SHOULD LOVE HER.

186
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:43,087
YEAH, BECAUSE I'M NOT TAKING
CARRIE FOR GRANTED ANY MORE.

187
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,523
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

188
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,958
WHAT LESSON?
YOU DIDN'T CHEAT.

189
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,728
WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX
IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.

190
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,430
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
SEX IN ANY SENSE.

191
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,699
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY WISHES

192
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,333
THEY GOT THE WRONG MESSAGE
ON THEIR MACHINE.

193
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:02,290
OK, SO I'M GONNA
LEAVE HER $5,

194
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:05,526
AND I'M THINKING YOU
SHOULD STIFF HER.

195
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:06,844
WHAT? NO, I'M NOT
STIFFING HER.

196
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:09,213
OH, COME ON. YOU OWE ME
ONE, MR. BIG TIPPER.

197
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,199
AND BY THE WAY,
I TALKED TO MY MOM.

198
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,534
12% IS VERY GENEROUS
FOR BEVERAGES.

199
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:15,369
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS WHOLE
THING IS REALLY STUPID,

200
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:16,904
AND I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

201
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:19,306
OH, I SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

202
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:21,125
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

203
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,727
YOU OVER-TIPPED ON PURPOSE
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

204
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,862
IF I HOOK UP WITH
SOMEONE, I'M GONNA MOVE OUT

205
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,130
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL ALONE.

206
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,965
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I DID,

207
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:28,966
BECAUSE I'D HATE TO
COME HOME EVERY NIGHT

208
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:32,236
NOT SEEING YOU DO
PILATES IN A HALF-SHIRT.

209
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,537
HEY, LOOK, THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.

210
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:35,373
THE POINT IS, EVER
SINCE THE HOLIDAYS,

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
YOU'VE BECOME MORE
AND MORE POSSESSIVE.

212
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,609
AND OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE NOTICED.

213
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:39,994
OH, HAVE THEY?
YEAH. YEAH.

214
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:41,796
OH, GOOD. SIENNA,
I'M READY.

215
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:48,385
OK, THE BILL
FOR ME IS 10.85.

216
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,488
HERE'S 20.
KEEP THE CHANGE.

217
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,256
AH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

218
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,876
UH, OK, WELL, UM,
THIS IS FOR THE FOOD.

219
00:09:55,944 --> 00:10:00,497
AND, UH, HERE'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING EXTRA FOR YOU.

220
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,700
THIS IS A $100 BILL.

221
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,453
YUP, THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

222
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:10,308
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
EXPECT IN RETURN FOR THIS,

223
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,759
BUT I'M NOT FOR SALE.

224
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,380
SEE YOU AT HOME, LUMPY.

225
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,270
MMM. THAT FEELS SO GOOD, BABY.
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

226
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,973
NOTHING. I JUST GOT THE
GREATEST WIFE IN THE WORLD

227
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,277
AND I WANT HER TO KNOW I APPRECIATE HER.

228
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:33,063
DOUG, THAT IS SO SWEET.

229
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,339
YOU'VE
REACHED THE HEFFERNAN HOUSE.

230
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:42,606
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

231
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,141
HI, DOUG.

232
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:50,314
IT'S JESSICA.

233
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,283
LOOK, I KNOW I PROMISED
NOT TO CALL AGAIN,

234
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,885
BUT, UM...

235
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:56,787
I'M HAVING SOME WINE AND...

236
00:10:56,855 --> 00:11:00,124
I COULDN'T HELP THINKING
ABOUT LAST SATURDAY,

237
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,477
LYING NAKED ON THE SAND.

238
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,685
I STILL QUIVER WHEN I THINK
ABOUT BEING WITH YOU.

239
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,789
OH, GOD. WHAT AM I DOING?

240
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,591
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED YOU.
I'M SORRY.

241
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:19,259
I WON'T BOTHER YOU AGAIN.
I LOVE YOU.

242
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:29,153
DEACON. HE IS THE MAN
OF A THOUSAND VOICES.

243
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,320
COME ON.

244
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:32,990
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

245
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:34,509
OH, MY GOD. IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK, ALL RIGHT?

246
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:37,077
LOOK, THERE'S ANOTHER DOUG HEFFERNAN,

247
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,679
AND THIS GIRL, SHE GOT THE WRONG NUMBER.

248
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:40,681
AND I TRIED TO TELL
HER I WASN'T THAT DOUG,

249
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:42,350
BUT SHE DIDN'T
BELIEVE ME,

250
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,168
SO I JUST- I HAD TO
BREAK UP WITH HER, AND-

251
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:51,776
THAT DIDN'T GO WELL BECAUSE
SHE'S REALLY INTO ME.

252
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:54,511
CARRIE,
I SWEAR TO GOD,

253
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:55,847
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT YOU.

254
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,398
I GOT TO THROW UP.
I SWEAR.

255
00:11:57,465 --> 00:12:00,083
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN, CALM DOWN.

256
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,052
I BELIEVE YOU.

257
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,370
REALLY?

258
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:06,890
YES. BUT NEXT TIME, INSTEAD
OF BEING SUCH AN IDIOT,

259
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,676
TELL ME ABOUT IT, OK?

260
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:10,895
AH, BABY, COME HERE.
YOU'RE TREMBLING.

261
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,830
AW.
OK.

262
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,048
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

263
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:16,033
HEY, YOU'RE BEING REALLY
COOL ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW?

264
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,336
OH, COME ON. I KNEW THAT THERE
WAS NO WAY THAT COULD BE YOU.

265
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,394
UH...

266
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:31,599
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
THAT THAT COULDN'T BE ME?

267
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,234
OH. JUST BECAUSE I
TRUST YOU.

268
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:37,772
AND THAT MESSAGE,
I MEAN, COME ON! HA HA!

269
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,741
WE WEREN'T EVEN TOGETHER
SATURDAY NIGHT.

270
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,509
I TOLD YOU I WENT BOWLING,
BUT I CAN'T EVEN PROVE THAT,

271
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:45,412
BECAUSE I PAID CASH, SO THAT
VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN ME.

272
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,249
THAT'S TRUE. STILL.

273
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:54,338
FOR GOD'S SAKES, MY
- MY SHIRT WAS RIPPED WHEN I CAME HOME, REMEMBER?

274
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,423
YEAH. YOU SAID YOU CAUGHT
IT IN THE BALL RETURN.

275
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,641
AND YOU BELIEVED THAT?

276
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,044
I MEAN, ANY REASONABLE PERSON
WOULD THINK I CHEATED ON YOU.

277
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,762
OK, BABY.

278
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,105
I COULDN'T HELP THINKING

279
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:16,494
ABOUT LAST SATURDAY,
LYING NAKED ON THE SAND.

280
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:20,514
I STILL QUIVER WHEN I THINK
ABOUT BEING WITH YOU.

281
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:23,784
OH, GOD. WHAT AM I DOING-

282
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,669
SHE DID NOT
JUST SAY "QUIVER."

283
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,104
SHE DID.
AND DOUG WAS AFRAID

284
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,006
THAT I WOULD THINK
IT WAS HIM.

285
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:35,463
I GOT TO SAY, THOUGH, THIS OTHER
DOUG HEFFERNAN SOUNDS PRETTY AMAZING.

286
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,147
HE DOES!

287
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,787
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

288
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,856
I'M JUST GONNA GOOGLE
THIS GUY JUST FOR KICKS.

289
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,792
YOU KNOW, WHEN DOUG AND
I WERE FIRST ENGAGED,

290
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,260
I WAS GETTING
COLD FEET,

291
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,729
SO I WENT TO SEE THIS
PSYCHIC ON CONEY ISLAND,

292
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:52,963
AND SHE SAID,

293
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:56,734
"YES, DOUG HEFFERNAN IS
THE GUY YOU SHOULD MARRY."

294
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,102
I HOPE I GOT
THE RIGHT ONE.

295
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,810
SO YOU'RE MAD BECAUSE
SHE BELIEVED YOU?

296
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:09,813
YES. I MEAN, I GIVE HER
SOME HALF-ASSED EXPLANATION,

297
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,049
AND SHE ACCEPTS IT
JUST LIKE THAT?

298
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,117
YOU KNOW WHAT I
SHOULD DO?

299
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,952
I SHOULD GO OUT AND HAVE A REAL AFFAIR

300
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:15,936
JUST TO SHOW HER.

301
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,388
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

302
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,123
NO. IT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF WORK.

303
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,124
OH, GOD.

304
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,492
WHAT?

305
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,660
THE RED LIGHT'S BLINKING.
THAT'S HER AGAIN.

306
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,162
IT COULD BE ANYBODY.

307
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,498
OH, PLEASE. YOU'RE
HERE. WHO ELSE CALLS ME?

308
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,001
HEY, DOUG HEFFERNAN,

309
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:34,287
THIS IS HECTOR
- JESSICA'S BOYFRIEND. YOU'RE DEAD, YOU HEAR ME?

310
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:36,089
YOUR FACE IS DEAD.
YOUR LEGS ARE DEAD.

311
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:39,009
YOUR WHOLE BODY'S DEAD.
YOU ARE DEAD.

312
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:46,617
NOW I'M REALLY STARTING
TO ENJOY THIS.

313
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,053
SHUT UP, ALL RIGHT? I GOT
TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT HERE.

314
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,387
I GOT
TO FIND JESSICA,

315
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:51,856
HOOK HER UP WITH THE
OTHER DOUG HEFFERNAN,

316
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,125
AND GET HER BOYFRIEND OFF MY BACK.

317
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,426
AND I GOT
TO TELL YOU,

318
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,496
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE NOT
CURSED WITH THIS CHARISMA.

319
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,450
WHY DO I HAVE
TO TALK TO HER?

320
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:06,386
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT SHE
THINKS THAT I THINK SHE'S A PROSTITUTE.

321
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:08,321
OH, GOD. I CAN'T WAIT TILL
YOU FINALLY DO MOVE OUT

322
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:10,524
AND I CAN STOP
CLEANING UP

323
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,593
THIS MESS YOU CALL
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

324
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,261
YEAH, OK, JUST GO. GO.

325
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,133
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

326
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,569
AH, ANYTHING ON TAP.

327
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:25,539
ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT MY FRIEND OVER THERE.

328
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,858
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

329
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,394
WELL, YOU KNOW
THE $100 HE GAVE YOU?

330
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,096
HE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BAD BY IT.

331
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:36,467
IT'S JUST THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU
GAVE HIM PRETZELS INSTEAD OF PEANUTS,

332
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,570
HE HAD THIS STUPID IDEA
THAT YOU LIKED HIM.

333
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,755
I DO LIKE HIM.

334
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,906
COME AGAIN?

335
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:46,977
I LIKE HIM A LOT.

336
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,897
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THAT GUY RIGHT OVER THERE?

337
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:53,266
YES. YES.

338
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:56,320
THE REASON I GOT SO
UPSET ABOUT THE MONEY,

339
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:58,622
I THOUGHT HE
DIDN'T RESPECT ME.

340
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,858
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU COULD
REALLY GET SERIOUS WITH HIM?

341
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,627
YEAH.

342
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:06,363
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GUYS HIT
IT OFF AND GET A PLACE TOGETHER?

343
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,965
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
HIS ROOMMATE, HUH? HUH?

344
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,935
WHAT ABOUT THE CAR THEY SHARE
AND THE JOINT CHECKING ACCOUNT?

345
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,372
UM, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY HERE.

346
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,773
EXCUSE ME.

347
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,215
SO?

348
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,984
SORRY, BRO. SHE
AIN'T INTO DUDES.

349
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,253
WHAT?!

350
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,473
YEAH. WHO WANTS
TO GO TO IKEA?

351
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,142
COME ON!

352
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:43,817
YES. HI. I NEED TO MAKE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH DR. HEFFERNAN.

353
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,138
OH, HE IS? OK,
HOW ABOUT NEXT WEEK?

354
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:53,310
HE'S BOOKED ALL MONTH? LOOK,
I REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM.

355
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,478
IS HE FREE FOR LUNCH?

356
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,817
WORK WITH ME,
MILDRED. PLEASE.

357
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:03,587
ALL RIGHT, COULD YOU
SEND ME A PICTURE OF HIM?

358
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:05,488
NO, YOU'RE WEIRD.

359
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:14,731
YEAH, I'M LOOKING FOR DOUG
HEFFERNAN. DOES HE LIVE HERE?

360
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,016
YEAH.

361
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,117
YEAH, WELL, HE'S BEEN
MESSING WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

362
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:18,351
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

363
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,921
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW
WHAT? CALM DOWN, CHACHI.

364
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,574
LOOK, YOU GOT THE WRONG
DOUG HEFFERNAN, OK?

365
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,677
HERE'S THE ADDRESS OF THE
GUY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

366
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,196
AND GOOD LUCK GETTING
AN APPOINTMENT.

367
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:34,802
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA COME WITH. HANG ON.

368
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,329
WHO IS IT?

369
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,547
IT'S DOUG HEFFERNAN.

370
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,215
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD!

371
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:52,953
NO, NO. NOT "OH, MY GOD." NO,
NO. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

372
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,321
UM, IT'S JUST GONNA
BE A MINUTE.

373
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,156
OH, GOD. MY PLACE
IS A MESS.

374
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,942
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
CLEAN IT. I WOULDN'T.

375
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,064
DOUG? UH,
WHERE'S DOUG?

376
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:07,400
YOU'RE GONNA GET
A KICK OUT OF THIS.

377
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:11,038
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
WHEN WE GET THERE,

378
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:13,607
I'M GONNA GO INSIDE, GET A
LOOK AT HIM, SEE WHAT'S WHAT,

379
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,408
AND THEN YOU CAN CARVE HIM
UP LIKE A TURKEY, ALL RIGHT?

380
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:18,128
WHOA! COULD YOU WATCH
THE POTHOLES?

381
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,130
I ALMOST POKED
MY FRICKIN' EYE OUT.

382
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:21,881
SORRY.

383
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,769
AND DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW DEVASTATED I WAS

384
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,471
WHEN YOU BROKE UP
WITH ME?

385
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,140
HEY, IT WAS A BAD DAY
FOR BOTH OF US, OK?

386
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,325
NOW, RELAX. I'M TAKING
YOU TO THE DOUG YOU WANT.

387
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:33,911
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT

388
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,587
SO THAT I'LL TELL MY
BOYFRIEND NOT TO KICK YOUR ASS.

389
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:37,197
OH. YOU MEAN THE BOYFRIEND
YOU FORGOT TO MENTION

390
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:38,849
WHILE WE WERE TOGETHER?

391
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,584
LOOK, IT'S
COMPLICATED, OK?

392
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:43,687
FINE.

393
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,841
SO YOU LIKE
THE BEACH, HUH?

394
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,286
OK, YOU GOT 5 MINUTES.

395
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:03,123
OK, YOU POINT THAT FINGER AT ME
AGAIN, AND I'M GONNA BREAK IT OFF.

396
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:09,646
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS.

397
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,248
OK.

398
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,183
CARRIE?

399
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,135
HEY, LISTEN,
I'M IN A RUSH,

400
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:17,036
SO I'LL JUST SEE YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE.

401
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:19,589
WHOA, WHOA! I JUST GOT
OUT OF MY CAR

402
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:21,508
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, THE SAME
WOMAN WHO'S BEEN LEAVING

403
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:25,528
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MESSAGES
ON THE MACHINE, HMM?

404
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:26,597
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT TO RUN. BYE.

405
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:27,698
WAIT A SECOND, CAR-

406
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,266
I COULD HAVE JUST
AS EASILY SLEPT WITH HER.

407
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,851
NO, YOU COULDN'T.

408
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,703
SURE HE COULD. SHE'LL
SLEEP WITH ANYBODY.

409
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,204
THANK YOU.
OK? SEE THAT?

410
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:35,772
SHE'LL SLEEP WITH ANYBODY.
HEY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

411
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,040
I'M ANYBODY. YEAH!

412
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,342
EXCUSE ME.

413
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,109
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

414
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,360
I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN UP TO.

415
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:41,528
I'M SORRY. YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY.

416
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,080
WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN DOING HERE?

417
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,848
UM, I HAVE A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT.

418
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,182
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

419
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,834
WELL, COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING A FAKE AFFAIR ALL WEEK.

420
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,469
LET ME HAVE
A LITTLE FUN.

421
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,688
UH-UH. UH-UH. YOU'RE STUCK
WITH THIS DOUG HEFFERNAN,

422
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,456
NOT DR. QUIVER. NOW,
LET'S GO HOME. COME ON.

423
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,525
DOUG, COME ON.
I'VE COME ALL THIS WAY.

424
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:57,460
LET ME JUST GET ONE
MINUTE WITH HIM.

425
00:19:57,528 --> 00:20:00,264
NOPE. I CAN'T HAVE ONE,
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE.

426
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,099
OH, PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM.
DON'T HURT HIM, HECTOR.

427
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,284
OH, NO, NO. I'M NOT GONNA
HURT HIM. I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

428
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:05,518
BUT, HECTOR, PLEASE!

429
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:06,653
HE'S DEAD.

430
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,921
OH, GOD!

431
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:10,891
DR. HEFFERNAN,

432
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,694
I THINK ANOTHER ONE OF
YOUR WOMEN IS HERE.

433
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,915
OH, THAT'S THE ONE
FROM THE BEACH.

434
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,251
I'D BETTER GO DOWN
THE BACK WAY.

435
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:33,213
HI. IT'S KEN.

436
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,851
UH, I HOPE THIS IS THE DOUG HEFFERNAN
I MET ON FIRE ISLAND LAST SUNDAY.

437
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,254
ANYWAY, I'D LOVE TO TAKE
YOU UP ON THAT CUP OF COFFEE.

438
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,488
CALL ME.

439
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:46,427
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, DOUG?

440
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,829
THAT YOU BELIEVE?!
