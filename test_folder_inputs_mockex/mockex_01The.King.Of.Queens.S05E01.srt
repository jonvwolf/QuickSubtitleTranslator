have checked with me

349
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:25,258
before you made
other plans.

350
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,781
Well, I'm sorry
about the mix-up.

351
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:30,270
Well, he's sorry. I guess
that makes it all OK.

352
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:33,973
Did I walk into
something weird?

353
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,549
What are you
saying, Douglas?

354
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:39,977
I'm not allowed to have a
night out with my friends.

355
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,158
You know what?
You're right.

356
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:43,840
You can do
whatever you want.

357
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:47,800
As long as I'll be seeing
you later upstairs.

358
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,896
I don't think
I like your tone.

359
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:51,821
All I'm saying is

360
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,769
I think I've been
treating you pretty well,

361
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,229
and so I want you...

362
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:58,176
upstairs.

363
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,804
Wait a minute.

364
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:02,198
Is this what
all this is about?

365
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:05,041
The fancy dinners,
the rides in the country...

366
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:09,287
was that all just to get
me to sleep with you?

367
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:14,682
Oh, boy.

368
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:16,088
Oh, don't act
surprised.

369
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,323
You knew what you
were getting into.

370
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:19,185
What?!

371
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,462
You ordered
a $50 lobster.

372
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,122
What, you didn't think I was
going to come knocking?

373
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:25,252
That's the way it
works, sweetheart.

374
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:27,295
I see.

375
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,862
And here I was thinking
we had something special.

376
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,936
Silly me.

377
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:34,990
Let's go, Mickey.

378
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,171
[Sighs]

379
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:44,824
[Vacuum Whirring]

380
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,403
Holly, Mimicking Carrie:
No, no, no, no.

381
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,094
I'm Carrie.
I'm the project supervisor.

382
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,202
You're doing it all wrong. No, the
subpoenas are supposed to go over here,

383
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,607
and then you broke
the copy machine.

384
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,883
You're bad, and I'm good.

385
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,406
Blah blah blah blah...

386
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:04,459
Priscilla:
You have her nailed.

387
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:05,833
She does that angry walk
when she's mad.

388
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:08,611
She's like--
ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh...

389
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:13,430
Hey, Car.

390
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,252
Hey.
What you doing?

391
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,688
You mocking me?

392
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:18,093
No, no, no. I was just--

393
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:19,626
I was trying
to lighten the mood up.

394
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,382
Well, just, you know,
it's been...

395
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,202
it's been a little tense
here lately, so...

396
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:25,532
Oh, so, I guess imitations,
they lighten the mood?

397
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:27,033
Sometimes!
Yeah? Oh, OK!

398
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:28,598
'Cause I got some
imitations of my own.

399
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:32,046
"I--I thought I was
supposed to be in charge.

400
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,355
"Why--Why is he
sharpening pencils?

401
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,537
That's supposed
to be my job."

402
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:36,164
"Oh, you don't want
to be my friend?

403
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:37,921
Wah wah wah wah!"

404
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:41,209
Those didn't sound
anything like us.

405
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:42,263
Oh, no?

406
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,083
Oh, OK. Well, here's one
I know I can do.

407
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:46,957
OK, this is me
firing all of you,

408
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:48,106
and it goes a little
something like this.

409
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,096
[Clears Throat]

410
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,309
You're all fired.

411
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:51,553
Neal: What?
Yeah.

412
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:52,862
That's right.
On out.

413
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:54,013
We'll mail
your coats to ya.

414
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:55,449
Yeah, oh, I think
you had enough.

415
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,014
Neal: Unbelievable.

416
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:58,483
Oh, believe it,
buddy boy.

417
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:00,654
Yeah, I can do it.
Watch it happen.

418
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:03,048
Right. Get to going.
Yeah, there ya go.

419
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,347
OK, you know what?
You're gone, too.

420
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,039
Bye-bye.
Yeah, hit it.

421
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,158
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

422
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:09,563
Yeah, you <i>habla</i> now,
honey, right?

423
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,126
I'm yelling at you. Yeah.

424
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,257
[Sighs]

425
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:29,166
Hey, bud.

426
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:30,348
What do you want?

427
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:33,189
Whoa, hey, look...

428
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:34,626
I just wanted
to apologize

429
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:35,903
for the way
I acted before.

430
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,851
Nothing to apologize for.

431
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,277
I understand you have
physical needs,

432
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:44,364
and I was a fool to think it
was anything more than that.

433
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:46,983
OK.

434
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:48,355
OK, yes, look, it started
as a physical thing,

435
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:49,665
but then...

436
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,771
I don't know, after a
while, it became...

437
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:52,922
much more.

438
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,976
We really had some
good times together.

439
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,094
How about our day
on the Boardwalk,

440
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,753
playing Skee-Ball
and...

441
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:02,595
getting stuck on top
of the Ferris wheel.

442
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,969
You told me that story
about how you were there

443
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,309
the day they demolished
Ebbets Field.

444
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,002
I mean,
it was great.

445
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,567
Yeah, it was
quite a sight,

446
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,898
seeing that old
ballpark go down.

447
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,271
I bet it was.

448
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:18,463
Well, thank you,
Douglas.

449
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:20,763
I appreciate
what you said.

450
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:21,848
Good night--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

451
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:22,933
Where ya going?

452
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,297
Downstairs.

453
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:26,318
Well, come on up.
One more time.

454
00:20:26,382 --> 00:20:27,339
For old time's sake.

455
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:29,191
Oh, I don't
think so.

456
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,342
Come on.
I can't.

457
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:31,331
It's really
very late.

458
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,735
No, it's not late
at all. It's fine.

459
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,333
Well, I certainly
cannot spend the night.

460
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,513
Yeah, we'll see.
OK.

461
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,080
What the...

462
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:46,879
[Whispering] Help me.

463
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,364
Thank you so much
for helping me out here.

464
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:59,237
I gotta tell you,
you are a lifesaver.

465
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:03,388
Well, the paper chute
keeps jamming.
