10

<font size="24">Well, it's my first time,
so I'll go with Japanese.</font>

12
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,570
<font size="24">I guess we weren't able to issue
you the new model in time.</font>

13
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,730
<font size="24">I hate how this thing's tight in the chest.</font>

14
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,320
<font size="24">On top of which, we're sending you out to
fight in an Eva that was thrown together.</font>

15
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,490
<font size="24">So I'm really sorry about that.</font>

16
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,410
<font size="24">You finally let me get in
the pilot's seat, so we're good.</font>

<font size="24">You're a problem child, after all.
Well, we're counting on you.</font>

<font size="24">We cannot allow it to escape from Acheron!</font>

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,740
<font size="24">How could a containment system
as secure as Cocytus be neutralized?</font>

25
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,160
<font size="24">It was within the realm of possibility.</font>

the permafrost excavation</font>

all that was left were some bones.</font>

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,340
<font size="24">And this was the conclusion.</font>

30
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,180
<font size="24">That's it. Good luck!</font>

is about to engage the hostile.</font>

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,310
<font size="24">Oh, man!</font>

39
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,970
<font size="24">This thing is so not responsive!</font>

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,820
<font size="24">I guess that just leaves
brute force as my only option!</font>

41
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,210
<font size="24">Upper outer wall integrity compromised!</font>

44
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,260
<font size="24">Now moving into Acheron.</font>

45
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,140
<font size="24">Get Unit-05 to do something!</font>

46
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,100
<font size="24">You're not getting away from me!</font>

47
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,910
<font size="24">Ow! This hurts real bad, but...</font>

48
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,530
<font size="24">It's fun, so it's all good!</font>

49
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,460
<font size="24">No time left.</font>

50
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,460
<font size="24">And this unit can't take much more.</font>

51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,710
<font size="24">And the artificial arms
were forcibly synchronized,</font>

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,970
<font size="24">so they're not as powerful.</font>

53
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,760
<font size="24">Oh, fine!</font>

54
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,810
<font size="24">I'll let you have an arm!</font>

55
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,150
<font size="24">Drop dead already!</font>

56
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,880
<font size="24">Target obliterated.</font>

57
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,800
<font size="24">Unit-05 has been vaporized.</font>

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,170
<font size="24">Pilot appears to have been ejected.</font>

59
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,050
<font size="24">So, Unit-05's self-destruct program
functioned without a hitch...</font>

60
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,970
<font size="24">This was always part of the plan,</font>

61
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,770
<font size="24">but I feel bad about involving
kids to carry out adult agendas.</font>

62
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,440
<font size="24">Ow, that hurt...</font>

63
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,320
<font size="24">Synchronizing with an Eva is
more brutal than they'd said.</font>

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,540
<font size="24">Well, as long as I'm alive, it's all good.</font>

65
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,170
<font size="24">I feel awkward involving adults
for the sake of my own goals...</font>

66
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,130
<font size="24">Farewell, Eva Unit-05.</font>

67
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,800
<font size="24">You served well.</font>

68
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,940
<font size="24">It's been three years, hasn't it?
Since we last came here together.</font>

69
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,240
<font size="24">I ran away that time and...</font>

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,660
<font size="24">I haven't been here since.</font>

71
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,160
<font size="24">It doesn't seem real to me
that Mom was laid to rest here.</font>

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,370
<font size="24">I don't even remember her face.</font>

73
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,960
<font size="24">People deal with life by
letting their memories fade.</font>

74
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,960
<font size="24">But there are also some
things that we must never forget.</font>

75
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,380
<font size="24">And Yui taught me those things,
which are to be treasured.</font>

76
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,430
<font size="24">I come here to reaffirm those things.</font>

77
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,140
<font size="24">You don't have any
photos of her or anything?</font>

78
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,060
<font size="24">None remain.</font>

79
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,520
<font size="24">Even this grave is just for show.</font>

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
<font size="24">There's no body here.</font>

81
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,860
<font size="24">So you threw everything away,
just like my teacher said.</font>

82
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,940
<font size="24">It's all in my heart and mind.</font>

83
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,490
<font size="24">That's enough for now.</font>

84
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,330
<font size="24">It's time. I'll be returning without you.</font>

85
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,290
<font size="24">Dad!</font>

86
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,800
<font size="24">Um...</font>

87
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,390
<font size="24">I'm glad I got to talk to you today.</font>

88
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,100
<font size="24">Are you?</font>

89
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,350
<font size="24">Well, Shinji?</font>

90
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,310
<font size="24">You were worried about this and that,</font>

91
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,890
<font size="24">but it wasn't so bad when
you actually saw him, right?</font>

92
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,400
<font size="24">It's good that you came instead of
being wishy-washy at home, right?</font>

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,940
<font size="24">It was a visit to your
mother's grave, after all.</font>

94
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,530
<font size="24">You just dragged me
out here, Miss Misato.</font>

95
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,280
<font size="24">That's because, deep down,
you wanted to come.</font>

96
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,570
<font size="24">Be at least a little honest with yourself.</font>

97
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,540
<font size="24">Being honest with myself will
only make me more miserable.</font>

98
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,290
<font size="24">You lived up to everyone's
expectation and saved us.</font>

99
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,080
<font size="24">Have more confidence in yourself.</font>

100
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,050
<font size="24">I'm sure your father also recognizes
you for what you've accomplished.</font>

101
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,590
<font size="24">Yes? Katsuragi.</font>

102
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,560
<font size="24">Whoa-oa-oa!</font>

103
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,350
<font size="24">What did you say?!</font>

104
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,730
<font size="24">The Seventh Angel has been detected
off the coast of Sagami Bay.</font>

<font size="24">Area 2 Division engaging target.</font>

106

declared three minutes ago.</font>

107
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,180
<font size="24">I've got a visual on it, too.</font>

108
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,350
<font size="24">Currently transporting Unit-01 pilot.</font>

109
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,850
<font size="24">Implement Task 03 right
away, prioritizing Unit-00.</font>

110
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,440
<font size="24">Negative. Task 02 has
already been implemented.</font>

111
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,810
<font size="24">Task 02?!</font>

112
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,610
<font size="24">Don't tell me...!</font>

113
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,820
<font size="24">Just as I thought! Unit-02!</font>

114
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,780
<font size="24">Wow! One shot to take out the core!</font>

115
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,990
<font size="24">No! That was a decoy!</font>

116
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,630
<font size="24">Situation terminated!</font>

117
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,050

transit via Main Sagami Line 1.</font>

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,090
<font size="24">No change to ETA to Depot 9.</font>

119
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,470
<font size="24">Whoowee! So Unit-02's red, huh?</font>

120
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
<font size="24">Its color's not the only
thing that's different.</font>

121
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,350
<font size="24">Ultimately, Unit-00 and Unit-01</font>

122
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,600
<font size="24">are just the prototype and the test-type
used in the developmental process.</font>

123
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,560
<font size="24">But Unit-02 is different.</font>

124
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,530
<font size="24">It's none other than the world's first
real Evangelion, built for actual combat!</font>

125
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,450
<font size="24">The official production model!</font>

126
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,280
<font size="24">Allow me to introduce you
to the Euro Air Force ace,</font>

127
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,240
<font size="24">Captain Asuka Langley Shikinami.</font>

128
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,370
<font size="24">She's the 2nd Girl.
Designated pilot of Eva Unit-02.</font>

129
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,040
<font size="24">Long time no see, Misato.</font>

130
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,090
<font size="24">So that's the Unit-00 pilot, who was
chosen because she's the teacher's pet.</font>

131
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,930
<font size="24">And which one of you is the Unit-01 pilot,
who was chosen because he's daddy's boy?</font>

132
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,850
<font size="24">Uh, um...</font>

133
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,640
<font size="24">What are you, an idiot?!
Not being available in a moment of crisis?!</font>

134
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,310
<font size="24">How blind are you?!</font>

135
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,650
<font size="24">And unguarded, too.</font>

136
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,610
<font size="24">You're not even ashamed that
your Eva wasn't there to fight!</font>

137
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,280
<font size="24">That's what you get from a daddy's boy.</font>

138
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,830
<font size="24">Who the hell does that chick
think she is, anyway?!</font>

139
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,630
<font size="24">A captain already at our age, though?
That's awesome! Beyond awesome!</font>

140
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,170
<font size="24">That's like going from junior high
straight to grad school!</font>

141
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,050
<font size="24">Excuse me.</font>

142
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,050
<font size="24">Is this the right gate for
the Geofront's hub terminal?</font>

143
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,730
<font size="24">Er, yes. You'll have to transfer
at the fourth stop, though.</font>

144
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,150
<font size="24">I've only been gone for two years,
and I feel like Urashima Taro...</font>

145
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,270
<font size="24">Thanks, you're a lifesaver.</font>

146
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,400
<font size="24">By the way, isn't Katsuragi with you?</font>

147
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,450
<font size="24">I'm an old friend of hers.</font>

148
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,410
<font size="24">You're not the only one who knows
what a sloppy sleeper she is, Shinji Ikari.</font>

149
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,710
<font size="24">He's watched her sleep?</font>

150
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,630
<font size="24">Who is that guy?</font>

151
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,750
<font size="24">Man, oh, man, that was one rough job.</font>

152
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,300
<font size="24">The 3rd Angel and Eva Unit-05,
which were outstanding issues,</font>

153
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,010
<font size="24">were disposed of as planned.</font>

154
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,810
<font size="24">The cause, categorically
deemed an accident.</font>

155
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,510
<font size="24">The Marduk Plan at Bethany Base
will come to a standstill now.</font>

156
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,810
<font size="24">All has gone exactly as you had planned.</font>

157
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,060
<font size="24">As for the usual report on
the latest from Seele, just earlier, I...</font>

158
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,020
<font size="24">We took a look at it.</font>

159
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,360
<font size="24">Confirmation of the construction
of Mark 06 proved useful.</font>

160
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,820
<font size="24">Excellent.</font>

161
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,650
<font size="24">Here is the item as promised.</font>

162
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,030
<font size="24">The lost number that had been
stored for safekeeping as the spare.</font>

163
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,620
<font size="24">The waymark that will
entwine God and soul.</font>

164
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,750
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

165
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,880
<font size="24">It will open the door
to Human Instrumentality.</font>

166
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,170
<font size="24">The Key of Nebuchadnezzar.</font>

167
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,840
<font size="24">Then if you'll excuse me,</font>

168
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
<font size="24">I'm going to go do my
own thing for a while.</font>

169
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,680
<font size="24">Ryoji Kaji. Chief Inspection Officer.</font>

170
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,890
<font size="24">Is he a man that can be trusted?</font>

171
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,940
<font size="24">Have you lost a little weight, Ritsy?</font>

172
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,700
<font size="24">Wrong. I've gained 1,570 grams.</font>

173
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,740
<font size="24">I'd love to see for myself.</font>

174
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,910
<font size="24">I wouldn't mind, but this
room is being monitored.</font>

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,710
<font size="24">No problem. I already have fake
footage running on the system.</font>

176
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,960
<font size="24">Thoroughly prepared as ever, aren't you?</font>

177
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,130
<font size="24">I just don't like to lose.</font>

178
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,090
<font size="24">But you've lost.</font>

179
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,970
<font size="24">There's a scary lady watching us.</font>

180
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,300
<font size="24">Long time no see, Ryo.</font>

181
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,310
<font size="24">Hey, it's been a while.</font>

182
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,890
<font size="24">What the hell are you doing here?</font>

183
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,310
<font size="24">You're assigned to Euro, aren't you?</font>

184
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,190
<font size="24">I'm here on a special assignment.
I'll be at Headquarters for a while.</font>

185
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,610
<font size="24">The three of us can hang out together
again. Just like when we were students.</font>

186
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,280
<font size="24">I have no interest in
going back to those days!</font>

187
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,700
<font size="24">I only came to see Ritsuko!</font>

188
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,410
<font size="24">About Asuka. I got HR's okay. Bye!</font>

189
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,870
<font size="24">That was blatant jealousy.</font>

190
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,000
<font size="24">You've got a shot at her here, Ryo.</font>

191
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,210
<font size="24">Well, we'll have to see about that.</font>

192
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,300
<font size="24">Asuka Shikinami...</font>

193
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,720
<font size="24">I had no idea some people were
actually happy to pilot an Eva.</font>

194
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,060
<font size="24">I'm back.</font>

195
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,680
<font size="24">Wait, what the hell is this?!</font>

196
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,650
<font size="24">My room...</font>

197
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,850
<font size="24">How rude!</font>

198
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,860
<font size="24">That's my stuff.</font>

199
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,110
<font size="24">But then, what about my stuff?
Wait, what are you doing here, Shikinami?</font>

200
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,530
<font size="24">What are you, an idiot?</font>

201
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,160
<font size="24">It means they're giving you the boot.</font>

202
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,080
<font size="24">Well, when you consider who's
the more accomplished one here,</font>

203
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,620
<font size="24">the decision was obvious.</font>

204
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,160
<font size="24">You can't be serious!</font>

205
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,710
<font size="24">But why are Japanese
rooms so cramped?!</font>

206
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,500
<font size="24">I couldn't even fit
half of my stuff in here!</font>

207
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,090
<font size="24">And why do Japanese people
totally lack any sense of security?</font>

208
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,590
<font size="24">I don't know how you people
live in rooms without locks!</font>

209
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,260
<font size="24">Unbelievable!</font>

210
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,680
<font size="24">That's because the Japanese spirit is
about being perceptive and considerate.</font>

211
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,100
<font size="24">Miss Misato!</font>

212
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,440
<font size="24">You are so annoying!</font>

213
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,900
<font size="24">Hurry up and get lost
along with the trash.</font>

214
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,480
<font size="24">Oh, but Shin's staying here, too.</font>

215
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,440
<font size="24">What?!</font>

216
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,700
<font size="24">What you and Shin lack is
appropriate communication skills.</font>

217
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,830
<font size="24">As fellow pilots, you need to live
under the same roof and make nice.</font>

218
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,830
<font size="24">That's an order.</font>

219
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,390
<font size="24">Okay, all together now!</font>

220
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,400
<font size="24">Thank you for the meal!</font>

221
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,150
<font size="24">A cold beer after a hot bath
is still the best thing ever!</font>

222
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,080
<font size="24">Th-Th-There's some
weird animal in the bath!</font>

223
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,200
<font size="24">It's a kind of bird called penguins.</font>

224
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,620
<font size="24">His name is Pen Pen.</font>

225
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,800
<font size="24">You pervert!</font>

226
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,720
<font size="24">Jerk! You're sick! Unbelievable!</font>

227
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,429
<font size="24">They're starting to open up more.</font>

228
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,220
<font size="24">This is why I hate boys!
Blah</font>

229
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,890
<font size="24">Don't you, Pen Pen?</font>

230
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,700
<font size="24">"I'm not like them, either!"</font>

231
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,370
<font size="24">"I'm special!"</font>

232
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,910
<font size="24">"That's why, just like before..."</font>

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,670
<font size="24">You have to keep going it alone, Asuka.</font>

234
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,690
<font size="24">I guess Dad still won't answer the phone.</font>

235
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,690
<font size="24">A social studies field trip?</font>

236
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,690
<font size="24">Kaji's taking you?</font>

237
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,490
<font size="24">Yes. He said I should
invite everyone else along, too.</font>

238
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,160
<font size="24">Nothing good will come of
having anything to do with that guy.</font>

239
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,410
<font size="24">Then I'm gonna pass!</font>

240
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,580
<font size="24">No, you're not. "Harmony
is the greatest of virtues."</font>

241
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,040
<font size="24">You go, too, Asuka.</font>

242
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,250
<font size="24">Is that an order, too?</font>

243
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,510
<font size="24">Here we are, with the Tabgha
Moonbase right in front of our noses,</font>

244
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,930
<font size="24">and yet, they refuse
us permission to land.</font>

245
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,480
<font size="24">The Seele certainly can be nasty.</font>

246
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,900
<font size="24">The construction methods being used
on the Mark 06 differ from the others.</font>

247
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,560
<font size="24">Getting to ascertain that is enough.</font>

248
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,610
<font size="24">But there weren't supposed to be any
plans for construction beyond Unit-05.</font>

249
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,950
<font size="24">There are likely still undisclosed
Apocrypha of the Dead Sea Scrolls.</font>

250
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,620
<font size="24">Seele intends to follow their
script based on those writings.</font>

251
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,120
<font size="24">But even Seele must be aware
of Nerv's ultimate goal at this point.</font>

252
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,920
<font size="24">Even if they are, we have
but to follow our own path.</font>

253
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,470
<font size="24">Though it may mean turning
against the Word of God.</font>

254
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,430
<font size="24">Is that a person?</font>

255
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,850
<font size="24">Surely not...</font>

256
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,190
<font size="24">Nice to meet you, Father.</font>

257
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,230
<font size="24">Awesome! This is beyond awesome!</font>

258
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,690
<font size="24">Perpetual conservation of
the marine life that was lost</font>

259
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,530
<font size="24">and restoration of the
oceans that had turned red!</font>

260
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,740
<font size="24">Truly, a forbidden sanctuary carrying
out grand godlike experimental projects!</font>

261
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,120
<font size="24">Just getting to scratch the surface
and tour even a small part of it is...</font>

262
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,040
<font size="24">Truly, it's like, this is
what good friends are for!</font>

263
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,040
<font size="24">Awesome!
Blah</font>

264
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,060
<font size="24">If you're going to thank
someone, thank Mr. Kaji.</font>

265
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,050
<font size="24">Here's where things get complicated.</font>

266
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
<font size="24">Huh?</font>

267
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,180
<font size="24">Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!</font>

268
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,560
<font size="24">C-Cold! Cold!</font>

269
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,610
<font size="24">Not again.</font>

270
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,400
<font size="24">Nooo!</font>

271
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,870
<font size="24">I can't take any more of this...</font>

272
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,009
<font size="24">What a huge tank!</font>

273
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,840
<font size="24">Amazing!</font>

274
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,430
<font size="24">So these are the creatures
from before the Second Impact.</font>

275
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,890
<font size="24">Holy...! They're alive!</font>

276
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,230
<font size="24">Awesome! Beyond awesome!</font>

277
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,940
<font size="24">Ooh, here's one with
somethin' on its back!</font>

278
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,359
<font size="24">I hear they're called "turtles."</font>

279
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,070
<font size="24">"Turtuls"?</font>

280
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,820
<font size="24">Look at the kiddies getting all excited.
Talk about idiotic.</font>

281
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,420
<font size="24">I'm glad you were able
to come with us, Ayanami.</font>

282
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,250
<font size="24">Are you okay now, health wise?</font>

283
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,710
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

284
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,970
<font size="24">I finished my allotment,
so I'm fine today.</font>

285
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,800
<font size="24">It's so cramped in there.</font>

286
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,430
<font size="24">They should go swim in the bigger areas.</font>

287
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,760
<font size="24">They can't.</font>

288
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,890
<font size="24">They can only survive in there.</font>

289
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
<font size="24">Just like me.</font>

290
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,530
<font size="24">Time to eat!</font>

291
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,660
<font size="24">This is good. I didn't expect that.</font>

292
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,950
<font size="24">Yeah, excellent job on
the grilling and seasoning.</font>

293
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,210
<font size="24">To think the 90% artificial meat can
become this tasty when cooked right.</font>

294
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,880
<font size="24">It's truly astounding!</font>

295
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,460
<font size="24">Shinji, that's a hidden
talent ya got there.</font>

296
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,470
<font size="24">Miss Misato only goes
for microwavable foods,</font>

297
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,260
<font size="24">so it's either I cook or nothing.</font>

298
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,430
<font size="24">Women love men who know
their way around a kitchen, Shinji.</font>

299
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,850
<font size="24">You hear that?</font>

300
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,850
<font size="24">Nuh-uh! I'm not gonna cook!
That's no job for a man!</font>

301
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,350
<font size="24">Talk about old-fashioned. So idiotic.</font>

302
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,110
<font size="24">The hell d'you say?!
It's important to have yer principles!</font>

303
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,440
<font size="24">That's even more idiotic.</font>

304
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,650
<font size="24">The hell d'you say?!</font>

305
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,950
<font size="24">Sorry, Ayanami, was it not to your taste?</font>

306
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,580
<font size="24">No, I just don't eat meat.</font>

307
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,910
<font size="24">Why do you Japanese apologize when
you haven't even done anything wrong?!</font>

308
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,170
<font size="24">And you!</font>

309
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,460
<font size="24">Living things eat other
living things to survive!</font>

310
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,630
<font size="24">That's precious life there,
so clean your plate!</font>

311
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,590
<font size="24">Are you trying to pick a fight,
Teacher's Pet?!</font>

312
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,010
<font size="24">Comin' through, comin' through.</font>

313
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,060
<font size="24">In that case, I'll just help myself.</font>

314
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,730
<font size="24">Ya aren't gettin' any!</font>

315
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,060
<font size="24">Greedy bastard! Get away from me!</font>

316
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,400
<font size="24">Moron!</font>

317
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,030
<font size="24">Idiotic.</font>

318
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,200
<font size="24">Then, how about some miso soup?</font>

319
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,870
<font size="24">It'll warm you up.</font>

320
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,170
<font size="24">It's delicious.</font>

321
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,340
<font size="24">To think that this is our Mother Earth.</font>

322
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,550
<font size="24">I can't look at it. It breaks my heart.</font>

323
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,060
<font size="24">However, there are also those who
wished for this miserable state.</font>

324
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,230
<font size="24">Because it's a world barred to man,
cleansed and untainted by original sin.</font>

325
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:36,030
<font size="24">I would rather have a
chaotic world tainted by man.</font>

326
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,700
<font size="24">Chaos is merely a human impression.</font>

327
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,740
<font size="24">The world is composed
entirely of harmony and order.</font>

328
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,950
<font size="24">So, it is the human heart that
throws the world into confusion.</font>

329
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,210
<font size="24">It's hard for me to imagine</font>

330
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,170
<font size="24">that this ocean used
to be blue before I was born.</font>

331
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,170
<font size="24">It's amazing that we were even
able to restore the environment</font>

332
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,420
<font size="24">to the point where we
humans could live in it.</font>

333
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,590
<font size="24">But this sea breeze...</font>

334
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,560
<font size="24">It smells kind of weird
and fishy, doesn't it?</font>

335
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,060
<font size="24">It's the smell of decaying marine life.</font>

336
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,730
<font size="24">It's proof that they were alive.</font>

337
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,440
<font size="24">Not like that red water with nothing in it.</font>

338
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,230
<font size="24">This is how the real
ocean's supposed to be.</font>

339
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,320
<font size="24">By rights, this world should be
vast and filled with all kinds of life.</font>

340
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,620
<font size="24">And I wanted you guys to know that.</font>

341
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,780
<font size="24">It makes me happy somehow.</font>

342
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,040
<font size="24">Miss Misato should have come, too.</font>

343
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,160
<font size="24">Katsuragi would never come.</font>

344
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,790
<font size="24">Because it would remind her.</font>

345
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,290
<font size="24">Of what?</font>

346
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,250
<font size="24">The Second Impact...</font>

347
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:25,390
<font size="24">Have you ever asked
Katsuragi why she joined Nerv?</font>

348
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,300
<font size="24">Katsuragi's father was
apparently the sort of man</font>

349
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,890
<font size="24">who lived for his research,
lived in his dreams.</font>

350
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,310
<font size="24">And she used to hate her father for that.</font>

351
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,150
<font size="24">I think she may have even despised him.</font>

352
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,150
<font size="24">So you don't get along with your father.</font>

353
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,860
<font size="24">You're the same as me.</font>

354
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,200
<font size="24">She's the same as me.</font>

355
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,610
<font size="24">But in the end,</font>

356
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,830
<font size="24">she was saved by her father.</font>

357
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,450
<font size="24">Being a survivor can mean a lot of things.</font>

358
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,250
<font size="24">You have to accept the
sacrifice of those who died</font>

359
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,630
<font size="24">and bear the burden of what they stood for.</font>

360
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,170
<font size="24">That's all the more true
if you're the sole survivor.</font>

361
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,340
<font size="24">You're not the only one who's got it rough.</font>

362
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,770
<font size="24">Target detected by Mauna Kea
Observatories three minutes ago.</font>

363
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,890
<font size="24">Currently entering orbital elements.</font>

364
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,850
<font size="24">Surveillance Satellite 3
has a visual on the target.</font>

365
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
<font size="24">Putting it on screen at
maximum magnification.</font>

366
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,450
<font size="24">An AT field powerful enough
to bend light? That's phenomenal.</font>

367
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,700
<font size="24">So, where do we expect it to land?</font>

368
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,030
<font size="24">Here, of course. Right?</font>

369
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,620
<font size="24">The Magi are also recalculating.</font>

370
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,250
<font size="24">Probability of a direct hit
on Nerv HQ is 99.9999%.</font>

371
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,470
<font size="24">The aerial N2 bombs are
having no effect whatsoever.</font>

372
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,470
<font size="24">So, no adjusting its trajectory.</font>

373
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,800
<font size="24">Its AT field is pushed out
to one concentrated point,</font>

374
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,470
<font size="24">and the energy from its
descent will add to that as well.</font>

375
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,480
<font size="24">So the Angel itself is acting as a bomb.</font>

376
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,480
<font size="24">In the event the
8th Angel scores a direct hit,</font>

377
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,020
<font size="24">the estimated diameter
of the blast is 420,000.</font>

378
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,570
<font size="24">With a geoid deviation of -15,000.</font>

379
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,650
<font size="24">New Tokyo-3 will be vaporized.</font>

380
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,570
<font size="24">The Central Dogma will be completely
exposed, to say nothing of the Geofront.</font>

381
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,660
<font size="24">Where's Commander Ikari?</font>

382
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,540
<font size="24">Signals in the upper atmosphere
are unstable due to the Angel.</font>

383
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,950
<font size="24">We can't reach him at this time.</font>

384
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,170
<font size="24">We'll have no choice but
to make the call ourselves here.</font>

385
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,670
<font size="24">Notify the Japanese government
as well as all ministries.</font>

386
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,300
<font size="24">Under Nerv's authority,
we are issuing Special Declaration D-17.</font>

387
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,010
<font size="24">Immediately commence the evacuation
of all residents within a 120km radius.</font>

388
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,470
<font size="24">Not a problem.</font>

389
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,430
<font size="24">People connected to the government have
already begun scrambling to evacuate.</font>

390
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,990
<font size="24">Evacuation of civilians
within city limits completed.</font>

391
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,250
<font size="24">Evacuation of noncombatants and
Class D Workers has been completed</font>

392
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,920
<font size="24">in accordance with Departmental Warning C.</font>

393
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,920
<font size="24">We've asked Matsushiro
to handle the backup of the Magi.</font>

394
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,800
<font size="24">So, what's the plan?</font>

395
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,170
<font size="24">Even our Evas aren't capable of flying...</font>

396
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,050
<font size="24">Severe spatial distortion also makes
sniping from various angles impossible.</font>

397
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,350
<font size="24">There's nothing we can do
against a monster like this.</font>

398
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,919
<font size="24">Are you serious?</font>

399
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,230
<font size="24">Yes, I am.</font>

400
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,940
<font size="24">Can this plan really be called a strategy?</font>

401
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,070
<font size="24">Even the Magi have verified that the
probability of failure is a little over 99%.</font>

402
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,240
<font size="24">Even if it succeeds, we'll lose three Evas.</font>

403
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,870
<font size="24">Speaking for the Technology Division,
that is absolutely unacceptable.</font>

404
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,040
<font size="24">Our chance of success isn't zero.</font>

405
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,680
<font size="24">Better to be down-to-earth and
work hard than wait for a miracle.</font>

406
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,460
<font size="24">We should make protecting
Lilith and Unit-01 our top priority.</font>

407
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,790
<font size="24">I have no intention of waiting.</font>

408
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,210
<font size="24">We're going to create
a miracle of man's own volition!</font>

409
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,840
<font size="24">Colonel Katsuragi!</font>

410
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,470
<font size="24">I am currently the ranking officer here.</font>

411
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,470
<font size="24">It's my decision to make.</font>

412
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,310
<font size="24">Besides, my job is to wipe out the angels.</font>

413
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,060
<font size="24">Your job? Your personal grudge, you mean?</font>

414
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,440
<font size="24">That's what your vendetta
against the Angels is.</font>

415
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,730
<font size="24">What?! Catch it with our hands?!</font>

416
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,440
<font size="24">That's right. As the Angel comes flying,</font>

417
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,530
<font size="24">you'll deploy your Eva's AT field
at maximum and catch it directly.</font>

418
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,700
<font size="24">The target is disguising its location,
so you won't be able to expect</font>

419
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,370
<font size="24">an accurate calculation of the trajectory
based on compensated observation.</font>

420
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,240
<font size="24">In order to give ourselves multiple
options as the situation dictates,</font>

421
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,370
<font size="24">this mission will involve all three
Evas being deployed simultaneously.</font>

422
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,920
<font size="24">You're wasting your time!
I can destroy it on my own!</font>

423
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,380
<font size="24">That'll be impossible.
A single Eva won't be able to cover</font>

424
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,170
<font size="24">the vast area within which
the Angel is estimated to land.</font>

425
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,970
<font size="24">What is this positioning based on?</font>

426
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,050
<font size="24">Woman's intuition.</font>

427
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,970
<font size="24">How arbitrary is that!</font>

428
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,800
<font size="24">Um, what's our chance of success?</font>

429
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,310
<font size="24">I'd have to say, God only knows.</font>

430
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,890
<font size="24">That's exactly why these millstones
around my neck will get in the way!</font>

431
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,020
<font size="24">I'm more than up to the task
of protecting mankind on my own!</font>

432

00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,180

have resulted in damage to three Evas,</font>

501
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,180
<font size="24">I take full responsibility for it.</font>

502
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,140
<font size="24">That's fine. In light of
the target's destruction,</font>

503
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,730
<font size="24">this level of damage might
actually be considered fortunate.</font>

<font size="24">Yes, you did well for
us, Colonel Katsuragi.</font>

505
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,110
<font size="24">Thank you very much.</font>

506
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,200

You did well, Shinji.</font>

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,910
<font size="24">What? Yes, sir...</font>

509
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,960
<font size="24">Then, Colonel Katsuragi,
I will leave the rest to you.</font>

510
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,960

been the norm for me, and yet...</font>

516
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:17,180
<font size="24">Solitude shouldn't bother me, and yet...</font>

517
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,530
<font size="24">H-Hey...</font>

518
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,280
<font size="24">Don't turn this way.</font>

519
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,580
<font size="24">Daddy's Boy, let me stay here,
just for a little while.</font>

520
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,380
<font size="24">Um... Miss... Shikinami?</font>

521
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,050
<font size="24">You got caught up in the moment
and called me by name today.</font>

522
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,640
<font size="24">I'll make a special exception.
You can call me Asuka.</font>

523
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,560
<font size="24">I'll call you Stupid Shinji, too.</font>

524
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,440
<font size="24">Then... um...</font>

525
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,150
<font size="24">Asuka, why do you pilot the Eva...?</font>

526
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:15,030
<font size="24">What a silly question.
Shut up, Stupid Shinji.</font>

527
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,990
<font size="24">I pilot the Eva for myself.</font>

528
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,040
<font size="24">What about you?</font>

529
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,210
<font size="24">I don't really know.</font>

530
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,960
<font size="24">What are you, an idiot?</font>

531
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,420
<font size="24">That's just how you avoid
owning up to whatever it is, right?</font>

532
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,510
<font size="24">Maybe I want Dad to praise me.</font>

533
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,010
<font size="24">He praised me for the first time today.</font>

534
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,770
<font size="24">For the first time, I
felt happy to be praised.</font>

535
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:51,110
<font size="24">I wonder if Dad recognizes me
for my accomplishments now.</font>

536
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,280
<font size="24">Maybe it's just like Miss Misato said.</font>

537
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,870
<font size="24">You...</font>

538
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,330
<font size="24">really are an idiot.</font>

539
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,750
<font size="24">Did you watch it?</font>

540
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,140
<font size="24">All righty, time to eat!</font>

541
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,750
<font size="24">It's the best part of school, after all!</font>

542
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,380
<font size="24">What?! You didn't bring us lunch?!</font>

543
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,590
<font size="24">I was doing homework this morning
and I didn't have time to make it!</font>

544
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,430
<font size="24">And because of that, you
expect me to go without lunch?!</font>

545
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,560
<font size="24">Like I said, I'll be sure
to make lunch tomorrow!</font>

546
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,140
<font size="24">What's this? Another marital spat?</font>

547
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,310
<font size="24">No, it's not!</font>

548
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,320
<font size="24">Asuka, let me borrow
your face washing soap.</font>

549
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,160
<font size="24">Enough already, Misato! Get your own!</font>

550
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,030
<font size="24">Cheapskate!</font>

551
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,950
<font size="24">All righty, time to eat!</font>

552
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,370
<font size="24">Woohoo! Let's dig in!</font>

553
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,080
<font size="24">Hmm. It's so-so today.</font>

554
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,210
<font size="24">But it'd be even better
if he hadn't slacked off that day.</font>

555
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,880
<font size="24">Um, Asuka?</font>

556
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,840
<font size="24">Would you mind if I joined you?</font>

557
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,810
<font size="24">No, but I'm not sharing my lunch.</font>

558
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,020
<font size="24">Here, this is for you.</font>

559
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,690
<font size="24">You never seem to have lunch, so...</font>

560
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,360
<font size="24">Thank you.</font>

561
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,210
<font size="24">I'm so glad I worked up
the nerve to talk to you.</font>

562
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:22,700
<font size="24">Hikari, was it?</font>

563
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,740
<font size="24">You can have the rest.</font>

564
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,910
<font size="24">Whew, I'm stuffed!</font>

565
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,210
<font size="24">Thank you for the meal!</font>

566
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,040
<font size="24">That's a late lunch.</font>

567
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,380
<font size="24">Th-Thanks.</font>

568
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,880
<font size="24">So I hear Shinji makes your lunches?</font>

569
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,970
<font size="24">Well, you're not the
home cooking type anyway.</font>

570
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,970
<font size="24">I suppose not. Unlike you,
with time on your hands,</font>

571
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,730
<font size="24">I have boatloads of work to do
as a manager in the trenches.</font>

572
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,100
<font size="24">You're as serious as ever.</font>

573
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,820
<font size="24">I mean, that's your strength,
but it's also your weakness.</font>

574
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,860
<font size="24">Like the other day.
I heard that you went at it with Ritsy.</font>

575
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,990
<font size="24">Relax a little more.</font>

576
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:06,370
<font size="24">Unfortunately, my plate's
always full with duty and obligations.</font>

577
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,540
<font size="24">If you're too tense,
you'll never find a guy.</font>

578
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,710
<font size="24">Nobody asked you!</font>

579
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,560
<font size="24">"Thank you."</font>

580
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,650
<font size="24">Words of gratitude.</font>

581
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,440
<font size="24">Words I'd never spoken before.</font>

582
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,910
<font size="24">I'd never even said it to him...</font>

583
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,780
<font size="24">Rise!</font>

584
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,160
<font size="24">Bow!</font>

585
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,790
<font size="24">Be seated!</font>

586
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,330
<font size="24">Ayanami's absent again, huh? No matter.</font>

587
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,130
<font size="24">She seemed well yesterday.</font>

588
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:00,130
<font size="24">Now, I'm going to give you back</font>

589
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:00,130
<font size="24">the test from the other day,</font>

590
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,460
<font size="24">I wonder what happened.</font>

591
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,880
<font size="24">Just like me.</font>

592
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,800
<font size="24">They can only survive in there...
What did she mean?</font>

593
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,100
<font size="24">Rei.</font>

594
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,400
<font size="24">Time for a meal.</font>

595
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,070
<font size="24">Yes, sir.</font>

596
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,950
<font size="24">Commander Ikari.</font>

597
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,330
<font size="24">What is it?</font>

598
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,460
<font size="24">Are meals enjoyable?</font>

599
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,330
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

600
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:43,380
<font size="24">Is there pleasure in
eating with someone else?</font>

601
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,680
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

602
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,680
<font size="24">Cooking dishes is delightful...
Is that right?</font>

603
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,350
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

604
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,520
<font size="24">Commander Ikari,</font>

605
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:04,190
<font size="24">how about having a meal with
Ikari and the others sometime?</font>

606
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,490
<font size="24">No, I have no time for such...</font>

607
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,660
<font size="24">Honey, take care of Shinji for me...</font>

608
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,040
<font size="24">All right, I'll go.</font>

609
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,590
<font size="24">Simulated synch is normal for all pilots.</font>

610
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,010
<font size="24">Picking up no psychological contamination.</font>

611
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:32,300
<font size="24">LCL osmotic pressure
clears Categorization B.</font>

612
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,020
<font size="24">Jeez, this is so boring!</font>

613
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,060
<font size="24">If no Angels come, we're stuck
doing checks all day! Totally not cool.</font>

614
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,940
<font size="24">I don't see the problem.</font>

615
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:47,400
<font size="24">We're doing all this work so we can build a
peaceful daily life free of Angels, you know.</font>

616
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,490
<font size="24">Whee!</font>

617
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:49,780
<font size="24">Glorying in our repetitive daily lives:</font>

618
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:54,120
<font size="24">in a today just like yesterday,
a tomorrow probably just like today.</font>

619
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,580
<font size="24">That's something to be
grateful for, actually.</font>

620
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,500
<font size="24">Checks complete. All monitors
coming in loud and clear.</font>

621
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:06,710
<font size="24">Good work, you three. You
can come on out now.</font>

622
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,220
<font size="24">Back up to file 101.</font>

623

<font size="24">Commencing LCL drain in three minutes.</font>

624
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,350
<font size="24">This may not be for me to say,</font>

625
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:20,310
<font size="24">but such severe damage is going
to hinder our ability to run operations.</font>

626
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,190
<font size="24">Couldn't we just scrap the Vatican Treaty?</font>

627
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,570
<font size="24">I know.</font>

628
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,820
<font size="24">With each country only allowed
possession of a maximum of three Evas,</font>

629
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,900
<font size="24">there's no leeway in operational units.</font>

630
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,320
<font size="24">Even now, our repair work
is being prioritized for Unit-01.</font>

631
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,290
<font size="24">We're just barely managing
by juggling all the spare parts,</font>

632
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,540
<font size="24">so we don't even know when
we'll be able to repair Unit-00.</font>

633
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,750
<font size="24">The nationalistic ego of every
country is tangled up in that Treaty.</font>

634
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,920
<font size="24">Getting it revised will
be nearly impossible.</font>

635
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,760
<font size="24">On top of which, with
their loss of Unit-05,</font>

636
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,930
<font size="24">Euro and Russia seem to be embroiling
Asia in their various allegations.</font>

637
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,140
<font size="24">It gets to be something of a pain
when politics enters the picture.</font>

638
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,850
<font size="24">There's too much to do before we can
even get around to protecting mankind.</font>

639
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,150
<font size="24">Move! Move!</font>

640
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,370
<font size="24">Ooh, ow... That hurt...</font>

641
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,550
<font size="24">My glasses, my glasses...</font>

642
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,420
<font size="24">Um...</font>

643
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,390
<font size="24">Oh, sorry. Are you okay?</font>

644
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,720
<font size="24">Hello. Mari here.</font>

645
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:42,640
<font size="24">Yes, I seem to have glided off target.</font>

646
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,940
<font size="24">It looks like I'm in a school of some sort.</font>

647
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,270
<font size="24">What?!</font>

648
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,490
<font size="24">Well, you told me
to enter into Japan covertly!</font>

649
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,740
<font size="24">Won't you have the
Euro people work this out?</font>

650
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,780
<font size="24">Just be there for my
extraction later, okay?</font>

651
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,080
<font size="24">Thanks.</font>

652
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:12,010
<font size="24">You smell good. I can smell LCL on you.</font>

653
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,220
<font size="24">You're interesting.</font>

654
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,810
<font size="24">Well, mum's the word.
Okay, little Nerv doggy?</font>

655
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,450
<font size="24">Huh? That's strange...</font>

656
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,450
<font size="24">Hey. How about going on a date for once?</font>

657
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,250
<font size="24">I'm a guy.</font>

658
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,330
<font size="24">No problem.</font>

659
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,670
<font size="24">Gender has nothing to do with love.</font>

660
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,180
<font size="24">I'm kidding.</font>

661
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,640
<font size="24">Here.</font>

662
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,990
<font size="24">The smell of dirt...</font>

663
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,990
<font size="24">Worn out already?</font>

664
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,660
<font size="24">I expect to get the labor I paid for.</font>

665
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,370
<font size="24">Paid for? You mean that can of coffee?</font>

666
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:28,620
<font size="24">And you called this a date.</font>

667
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,540
<font size="24">I thought you were a
more serious person than this.</font>

668
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,340
<font size="24">For an adult, being more
devious than not is just about perfect.</font>

669
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,850
<font size="24">If I remember right, these
are watermelons, aren't they?</font>

670
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,890
<font size="24">Yeah. Cute, right?</font>

671
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:45,720
<font size="24">It's my hobby.</font>

672
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,560
<font size="24">Making things or growing things is great.</font>

673
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,520
<font size="24">It makes you see and
understand all kinds of things.</font>

674
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:55,320
<font size="24">Like about enjoyment.</font>

675
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,900
<font size="24">And about suffering, too, right?</font>

676
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,740
<font size="24">Do you hate suffering?</font>

677
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,530
<font size="24">I don't like it.</font>

678
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,540
<font size="24">Did you find something that you enjoyed?</font>

679
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,750
<font size="24">That's fine, too.
But people who know about suffering</font>

680
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,090
<font size="24">are capable of being kind
to others that much more.</font>

681
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,340
<font size="24">And that's not the same as being weak.</font>

682
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,220
<font size="24">Do you like Katsuragi?</font>

683
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:25,220
<font size="24">M-Miss Misato?</font>

684
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,890
<font size="24">Uh, well... I don't not like her.</font>

685
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,650
<font size="24">Protect Katsuragi for me.</font>

686
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:39,320
<font size="24">That's something I can't do. Only you can.</font>

687
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,780
<font size="24">Please.</font>

688
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,020
<font size="24">Morning.</font>

689
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:13,900
<font size="24">Ayanami!</font>

690
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,270
<font size="24">A greeting?</font>

691
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,320
<font size="24">From Ayanami?</font>

692
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,900
<font size="24">Ayanami, are you okay now?</font>

693
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,280
<font size="24">Yes, I'm fine today.</font>

694
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,990
<font size="24">What happened to your hand?</font>

695
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,910
<font size="24">Dr. Akagi put them on for me just earlier.</font>

696
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,330
<font size="24">What were you doing?</font>

697
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,000
<font size="24">It's a secret.</font>

698
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,750
<font size="24">I'll tell you once I get
a little better at it.</font>

699
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,520
<font size="24">Rei's changed.</font>

700
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,840
<font size="24">The idea of her doing something
for someone else is mind-boggling.</font>

701
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,730
<font size="24">What could have brought this on?</font>

702
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,480
<font size="24">Maybe... it's love!</font>

703
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,610
<font size="24">Surely not. Impossible.</font>

704
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,370
<font size="24">I wonder if Idiot Shinji
would prefer it to be milder.</font>

705
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,160
<font size="24">I'm back!</font>

706
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,000
<font size="24">Oh? Misato, you're early.</font>

707
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,540
<font size="24">I have to go right back to HQ.</font>

708
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,380
<font size="24">I only came home for
a bath and change of clothes.</font>

709
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,420
<font size="24">Ooh!</font>

710
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,800
<font size="24">Whoa!</font>

711
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,930
<font size="24">Oh, my, my! Are you going
to cook for Shin, too?</font>

712
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,220
<font size="24">What?!</font>

713
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,180
<font size="24">No! Um, it's for a girl...
Y-Yeah, it's for Hikari!</font>

714
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:37,270
<font size="24">First Rei and now you.
Getting romantic all of a sudden.</font>

715
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,480
<font size="24">What? Don't lump me
in with that teacher's pet!</font>

716
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:40,940
<font size="24">Hmm, I suppose I shouldn't.</font>

717
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,030
<font size="24">Rei seems to have something
more ambitious planned, after all.</font>

718
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:45,200
<font size="24">What do you mean?</font>

719
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,780
<font size="24">It looks like she wants to be the cupid</font>

720
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,030
<font size="24">who brings Commander
Ikari and Shin together.</font>

721
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,830
<font size="24">"Invite everyone to a dinner party
and serve a home-cooked meal"</font>

722
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,040
<font size="24">seems to be her plan of attack.
It's so direct, it's going to pack a punch.</font>

723
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,710
<font size="24">Seriously, bringing that family
closer together is no easy task.</font>

724
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,220
<font size="24">That girl's doing this for Idiot Shinji?</font>

725
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:10,010
<font size="24">It's a surprise, so no telling Shin, okay?</font>

726
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,760
<font size="24">As if I would!</font>

727
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,330
<font size="24">Vaporized?!</font>

728
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,830
<font size="24">Eva Unit-04 and Branch 2 were vaporized?</font>

729
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,920
<font size="24">This is data from ground zero at T plus 10.</font>

730
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,130
<font size="24">It's terrible.</font>

731
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,550
<font size="24">The satellite lets us verify
that the AT field collapsed,</font>

732
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,180
<font size="24">but the specifics remain unknown.</font>

733
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,810
<font size="24">So Unit-04 was at the center,
as we'd suspected.</font>

734
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,930
<font size="24">Tell me that our Evas are fine.</font>

735
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,350
<font size="24">Unit-04 was...!</font>

736
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,270
<font size="24">Unit-04 was the testbed
for a new internal engine</font>

737
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,730
<font size="24">that was meant to solve our
operational time limit issues.</font>

738
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,860
<font size="24">Or so I've heard.</font>

739
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,900
<font size="24">Nerv North America's R&D Intel</font>

740
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:12,530
<font size="24">hasn't been extensively
disclosed even to Dr. Akagi.</font>

741
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,030
<font size="24">Those who would know are...</font>

742
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,250
<font size="24">Eva Unit-04.</font>

743
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,790
<font size="24">It was an experimental
unit aimed at acquiring data</font>

744
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:23,210
<font size="24">for the development of a next-generation
Eva. Anything could have happened to it.</font>

745
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,880
<font size="24">But...</font>

746
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,590
<font size="24">Was it really an accident?</font>

747
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,130
<font size="24">Gimme three of these, ma'am.</font>

748
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,050
<font size="24">It's unusual for you to treat us, Toji.</font>

749
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:13,050
<font size="24">Yer so serious... I never thought you'd come
hang out with us for a cheap snack, either.</font>

750
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:17,220
<font size="24">Why don't you be honest and say
that your little sister's gotten better?</font>

751
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,020
<font size="24">Shaddup!</font>

752
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,100
<font size="24">Keep yer mouth shut 'bout
what's none of yer business! Moron!</font>

753
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,690
<font size="24">Say, Ikari.</font>

754
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,150
<font size="24">So, Unit-03's coming to Japan?</font>

755
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,740
<font size="24">It is? I haven't heard anything.</font>

756
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,950
<font size="24">Rumor is, the US suddenly
insisted that we take it,</font>

757
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,280
<font size="24">along with making us do
the activation test.</font>

758
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:40,700
<font size="24">Well, I guess you rank and file
pilots don't need to know about it.</font>

759
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:43,420
<font size="24">Say, who do you think will be piloting it?</font>

760
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,080
<font size="24">I don't know. I haven't heard anything.</font>

761
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:50,510
<font size="24">It must be so great to be a pilot!
I wish they'd pick me!</font>

762
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,050
<font size="24">Don't look at me.</font>

763
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,319
<font size="24">Try asking Miss Misato.</font>

764
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,180
<font size="24">Damn, I didn't win.</font>

765
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,650
<font size="24">Evangelion Unit-05 was lost earlier...</font>

766
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,110
<font size="24">And now, Unit-04 has similarly been lost.</font>

767
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,660
<font size="24">The loss of the two units will
hinder the progress of our plans, but...</font>

768
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,040
<font size="24">It is within correctable limits.
There should be no problem.</font>

769
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,670
<font size="24">The American government has
insisted on offering Eva-03 to you.</font>

770
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,710
<font size="24">Your country's government
is amenable to this as well.</font>

771
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,250
<font size="24">It's a state-of-the-art unit.</font>

772
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,050
<font size="24">It should be good enough
to be your main fire power.</font>

773
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:36,300
<font size="24">The elimination of Angels is
being executed on an ongoing basis.</font>

774
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,390
<font size="24">An untested unit cannot be trusted.</font>

775
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:43,520
<font size="24">If you would approve the additional
supplementary budget to repair Unit-00...</font>

776
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,770
<font size="24">The prototype's function
is beginning to grow obsolete.</font>

777
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,110
<font size="24">Surely, you have no need of it.</font>

778
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,940
<font size="24">Indeed. There are other
matters that should be given priority.</font>

779
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:55,150
<font size="24">The true Evangelion that we desire...</font>

780
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:00,160
<font size="24">With its birth and the resurrection of Lilith
the time of the covenant will be upon us.</font>

781
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,040
<font size="24">The necessary rites must
be performed by then.</font>

782
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,040
<font size="24">For the sake of the
Human Instrumentality Project.</font>

783
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,000
<font size="24">I am aware of this.</font>

784
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,500
<font size="24">All will go according to Seele's plan.</font>

785
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,840
<font size="24">The true Evangelion.</font>

786
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,550
<font size="24">To serve as its forerunners
until its completion...</font>

787
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,310
<font size="24">That's basically the job of all
the current units, including Unit-01.</font>

788
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,940
<font size="24">And that's the Mark 06?</font>

789
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:32,650
<font size="24">So they've finally decided they want
to create a real god instead of false ones.</font>

790
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:33,730
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

791
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,990
<font size="24">We must hasten the awakening of Unit-01.</font>

792
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:43,330
<font size="24">Eva Unit-02's core unit
separation complete.</font>

793
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,370
<font size="24">Why is my Unit-02 being
put into containment?!</font>

794
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,000
<font size="24">You know what the Vatican Treaty is, right?</font>

795
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,590
<font size="24">This is the condition in
exchange for getting Unit-03.</font>

796
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,340
<font size="24">Unit-00's still in for repairs,
so put it into containment!</font>

797
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:58,050
<font size="24">Euro still has possession
of the pass to Unit-02.</font>

798
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,220
<font size="24">There's nothing we can do about it.</font>

799
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,850
<font size="24">And it has no designated pilot now, either.</font>

800
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,520
<font size="24">Sit tight until we receive
further word from Euro.</font>

801
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,100
<font size="24">But no one can pilot it except me.</font>

802
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,020
<font size="24">The Evas are combat weapons.</font>

803
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:15,730
<font size="24">There's a backup for everything.
That includes the pilot.</font>

804
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,280
<font size="24">No, it can't be...</font>

805
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,370
<font size="24">But this is the one place
I belong in the entire world...</font>

806
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,520
<font size="24">The Evas mirror what's in our hearts.</font>

807
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,430
<font size="24">What was that?</font>

808
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,770
<font size="24">You don't have to be dependent on the Eva.
There's happiness for you outside the Eva.</font>

809
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,400
<font size="24">Don't patronize me!
You're just the teacher's pet!</font>

810
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,490
<font size="24">I was chosen to be a pilot on
my merits, because I'm a genius!</font>

811
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,910
<font size="24">I'm not like you two, who got
in through your connections!</font>

812
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,790
<font size="24">I'm just tied to it.</font>

813
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,750
<font size="24">I just don't have any ties with
people except through the Eva.</font>

814
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:13,830
<font size="24">Shut up!</font>

815
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,380
<font size="24">Commander Ikari just favors you,
because you're a prim doll,</font>

816
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,260
<font size="24">who does everything he says, right?!</font>

817
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,920
<font size="24">I'm not a doll.</font>

818
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:25,760
<font size="24">You are a doll!
Have a little more self-awareness!</font>

819
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,900
<font size="24">You've got some nerve for a doll.</font>

820
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:48,950
<font size="24">I've got just one question for you.
What do you think of that idiot?</font>

821
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,830
<font size="24">Idiot?</font>

822
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,540
<font size="24">"Idiot" as in "Idiot Shinji," of course.</font>

823
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,170
<font size="24">Ikari?</font>

824
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,080
<font size="24">Well?</font>

825
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,840
<font size="24">I don't really know.</font>

826
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,920
<font size="24">This is the problem with you Japanese!</font>

827
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,550
<font size="24">Say what you mean!</font>

828
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,010
<font size="24">I don't know.</font>

829
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:07,760
<font size="24">But being with Ikari makes
me feel all warm inside.</font>

830
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:11,850
<font size="24">I want Ikari to feel all warm inside, too.</font>

831
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,310
<font size="24">I want him to get along
with Commander Ikari</font>

832
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,860
<font size="24">and feel all warm inside.</font>

833
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,230
<font size="24">I get it.</font>

834
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,370
<font size="24">Seriously! Talk about
profoundly ultra-idiotic!</font>

835
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:30,040
<font size="24">That means she likes him!</font>

836
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,830
<font size="24">I can't wait for this dinner party.</font>

837
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,500
<font size="24">But I wonder if Ayanami's
cooking is going to be okay...</font>

838
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,640
<font size="24">I wish Father would come, too.</font>

839
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:52,520
<font size="24">The first unmanned solo
activation test of the Dummy System...</font>

840
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,350
<font size="24">So that's the Dummy System.</font>

841
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,190
<font size="24">It is ostensibly nothing more
than a support system for the pilot,</font>

842
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,480
<font size="24">but it is not only capable of
autonomous control on its own,</font>

843
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,400
<font size="24">but it can even generate an
AT field out of an unmanned unit.</font>

844
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:06,990
<font size="24">It is apparently more humane
than making children pilot them.</font>

845
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:17,460
<font size="24">There's something about it
that just rubs me the wrong way!</font>

846
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,790
<font size="24">It's a black box part direct
from Golgotha Base, after all.</font>

847
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,620
<font size="24">So it's remained a mystery to us.</font>

848
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:28,550
<font size="24">Entrusting our Evas to something
so sketchy just boggles my mind!</font>

849
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,260
<font size="24">Are you saying the Evas are safe in the
hands of the pilots because they're human?</font>

850
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,180
<font size="24">Shinji sure has your trust.</font>

851
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:38,850
<font size="24">Or rather, I guess it's because
of Shinji that you can say that.</font>

852
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,150
<font size="24">Never mind that.</font>

853
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,400
<font size="24">What about Intel on the organization
above us called Seele or something?</font>

854
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,190
<font size="24">Anything you can tell me?</font>

855
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,110
<font size="24">If you want to snoop around
about that project, I'd advise against it.</font>

856
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,740
<font size="24">That's not an option for me.
The Human Instrumentality Project...</font>

857
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,540
<font size="24">What is Nerv trying to
do behind the scenes?</font>

858
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,460
<font size="24">That's...</font>

859
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,920
<font size="24">something I'd like to know, too.</font>

860
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,970
<font size="24">We haven't had a meal together in ages,</font>

861
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,300
<font size="24">and all we talk about is work, work, work!</font>

862
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,180
<font size="24">Things are different
from when we were students.</font>

863
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,850
<font size="24">There's so much more that we're
aware of... burdens we've taken on.</font>

864
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:19,480
<font size="24">I guess neither of us can afford
to think only of ourselves anymore.</font>

865
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:24,230
<font size="24">And Shinji and the others are loaded
down with an even greater burden.</font>

866
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,400
<font size="24">Yeah.</font>

867
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,690
<font size="24">It's too much for kids to have to bear.</font>

868
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,280
<font size="24">But we have no choice
but to depend on them.</font>

869
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,620
<font size="24">Yes?</font>

870
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,670
<font size="24">Yes, I know.</font>

871
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:44,500
<font size="24">I'll make my decision by midnight.</font>

872
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:45,420
<font size="24">Ritsy?</font>

873
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,920
<font size="24">Yup. She's hounding me
about the Unit-03 test pilot.</font>

874
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,510
<font size="24">Personnel decisions are
your responsibility, after all.</font>

875
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,620
<font size="24">I know that, but...</font>

876
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:57,850
<font size="24">The schedule set for the
arrival of Unit-03...</font>

877
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:00,270
<font size="24">Of all days, it's coming on this day.</font>

878
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:03,650
<font size="24">The day they scheduled
the Unit-03 activation test for is...</font>

879
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,860
<font size="24">the day the teacher's
pet had picked out.</font>

880
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,410
<font size="24">Up we go!</font>

881
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,680
<font size="24">I see. So you've settled on Asuka.</font>

882
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,230
<font size="24">Yes, I'll head for
Matsushiro on the last flight out.</font>

883
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,060
<font size="24">I'll leave the rest to you, Maya.</font>

884
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,100
<font size="24">Yes, ma'am!</font>

885
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,360
<font size="24">Um, Dr. Akagi?</font>

886
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:52,820
<font size="24">I'd like to get a message
to the Second Girl.</font>

887
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,200
<font size="24">Please.</font>

888
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,550
<font size="24">You have one new message.</font>

889
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:11,090
<font size="24">First message.</font>

890
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,640
<font size="24">Here, Rei, you can talk now.</font>

891
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,715
<font size="24">Damn it!</font>

892
01:04:28,716 --> 01:04:29,940
<font size="24">Thank you.</font>

893
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,950
<font size="24">What is she, an idiot?!</font>

894
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,120
<font size="24">I'm only doing this because
I want to pilot the Eva.</font>

895
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:45,580
<font size="24">If I like Unit-03, have
it repainted red, okay?</font>

896
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,380
<font size="24">Good morning, Aida.</font>

897
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,250
<font size="24">Hey yo.</font>

898
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,710
<font size="24">Oh? Where's Toji?</font>

899
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,090
<font size="24">He's at the hospital in Odawara today.</font>

900
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,890
<font size="24">He said his little
sister's being discharged.</font>

901
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,260
<font size="24">Oh, right.</font>

902
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:01,640
<font size="24">Message for you from Toji.</font>

903
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,060
<font size="24">"Don't ya worry 'bout it anymore.
My sis's grateful, too."</font>

904
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,980
<font size="24">That's what he said.</font>

905
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,860
<font size="24">It's great how things
have worked out, huh, Ikari?</font>

906
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,030
<font size="24">Yeah.</font>

907
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:16,910
<font size="24">You've been invited over
by Ayanami today, right?</font>

908
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,625
<font size="24">Talk about lucky, you bastard!</font>

909
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:19,990
<font size="24">Whoa! I can't breathe!</font>

910
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,920
<font size="24">Mission director of the manned activation
testing of the Eva Unit-03 has arrived</font>

924
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,470
<font size="24">What's up, Asuka?
Thoughts before the show starts?</font>

925
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:21,300
<font size="24">I just felt like having a private
chat with you for some reason.</font>

926
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,100
<font size="24">I see.</font>

927
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,430
<font size="24">I want to let you know again that
I appreciate what you're doing today.</font>

928
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,180
<font size="24">Thank you.</font>

929
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:33,150
<font size="24">You don't need to thank me.</font>

930
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:37,030
<font size="24">It's the duty of the elite to help
the ignorant masses, that's all.</font>

931
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:40,240
<font size="24">And I'm not big on eating
with everyone anyway.</font>

932
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,870
<font size="24">And it's exhausting to have
to pretend you're enjoying yourself</font>

933
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,330
<font size="24">along with everyone else.</font>

934
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:47,290
<font size="24">And I didn't want to have to sit
around watching others be happy.</font>

935
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,620
<font size="24">And all I care about is piloting the Eva.</font>

936
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:52,130
<font size="24">And I like being by myself to begin with.</font>

937
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,710
<font size="24">And I had no use for phony friends.</font>

938
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,170
<font size="24">And there's never been anyone
who's seen me for the real me.</font>

939
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,470
<font size="24">And as long as I have
the top performance scores,</font>

940
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:03,680
<font size="24">I can make a living at Nerv.</font>

941
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,390
<font size="24">But some things happened recently</font>

942
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:08,470
<font size="24">that made me think being
around other people isn't all bad.</font>

943
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,940
<font size="24">It's so not me, though.</font>

944
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,940
<font size="24">That's not true.</font>

945
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,650
<font size="24">Because you have a kind heart.</font>

946
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:18,440
<font size="24">You're the first one I've
ever talked to like this.</font>

947
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,740
<font size="24">I feel better somehow.</font>

948
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,360
<font size="24">It feels nice to talk to someone.</font>

949
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,950
<font size="24">I had no idea.</font>

950
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:30,040
<font size="24">This world is brimming full of
fun things you have no idea about.</font>

951
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,620
<font size="24">You should enjoy it.</font>

952
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:35,210
<font size="24">Yeah, you're right.</font>

953
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,960
<font size="24">Thank you, Misato.</font>

954
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,880
<font size="24">By the way, it's great
that it's red, but...</font>

955
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:43,930
<font size="24">Don't you think this plug
suit for the test...</font>

956
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,930
<font size="24">is too revealing?</font>

969
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:30,310
<font size="24">Pull it back now! At this rate,
the pilot will cease to be a human!</font>

01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:45,980
<font size="24">Prepare to intercept ground-to-ground.</font>

1014
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:48,570
<font size="24">Blockade units, open fire!</font>

1015
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,070
<font size="24">It can't be!</font>

1016
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,160
<font size="24">An Angel?! This is an Angel?!</font>

1017
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,530
<font size="24">That's right, that's your target.</font>

1018
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,580
<font size="24">Target?</font>

1019
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,290
<font size="24">But this is...</font>

1020
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,210
<font size="24">an Eva!</font>

1021
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,340
<font size="24">This can't be...</font>

1022
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,590
<font size="24">The target is approaching.</font>

1023
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,840
<font size="24">You must defeat it.</font>

1024
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,720
<font size="24">You call it a target, but...</font>

1025
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,720
<font size="24">Isn't Asuka on board?</font>

1026
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,520
<font size="24">Asuka is...</font>

1027
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,500
<font size="24">Damn it!</font>

1028
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,340
<font size="24">The entry plug!</font>

1029
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,430
<font size="24">So she is on board!</font>

1030
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:29,920
<font size="24">Armor being corroded
near cervical vertebrae!</font>

1031
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:32,510
<font size="24">Contamination confirmed through Layer 6200!</font>

1032
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:35,930
<font size="24">As we had feared, an invasive type.
This will be tricky.</font>

1033
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,010
<font size="24">Unit-01's AT field is unstable!</font>

1034
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,010
<font size="24">Life support system malfunctioning!</font>

1035
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,310
<font size="24">Any more of this and
the pilot will be in danger!</font>

1036
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:45,480
<font size="24">This is bad! Cut the
neural connections to 28%!</font>

1037
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,350
<font size="24">Wait.</font>

1038
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,270
<font size="24">But Ikari, the pilot will die at this rate!</font>

1039
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,900
<font size="24">Shinji, why won't you fight?</font>

1040
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:55,530
<font size="24">Because... Asuka's on board, Dad!</font>

1041
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:59,450
<font size="24">It doesn't matter.
That's an Angel. It's our enemy.</font>

1042
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:02,160
<font size="24">But I can't do it!</font>

1043
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,080
<font size="24">I can't murder her!</font>

1044
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,370
<font size="24">You're going to die.</font>

1045
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:09,210
<font size="24">I don't care! Better than killing Asuka!</font>

1046
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,420
<font size="24">No matter.</font>

1047
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,170
<font size="24">Cut the pilot's synchronization
with Unit-01 across the board.</font>

1048
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,800
<font size="24">Ikari?</font>

1049
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,840
<font size="24">That's right. Switch control
over to the Dummy System.</font>

1050
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:21,510
<font size="24">But the Dummy System
still has a lot of problems</font>

1051
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,520
<font size="24">and without Dr. Akagi's instruction...</font>

1052
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,100
<font size="24">It will be of more use
than the current pilot.</font>

1053
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,520
<font size="24">Do it!</font>

1054
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,020
<font size="24">Yes, sir.</font>

1055
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,420
<font size="24">What is this?</font>

1056
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,180
<font size="24">What are you doing, Dad?!</font>

1057
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,560
<font size="24">Main control system switchover complete.</font>

1058

- Dummy System operational time limit is a maximum of 208 seconds.</font>

1060
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:17,150
<font size="24">Fine. Release the System. Commence attack.</font>

1061
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:50,730
<font size="24">Is this the power of the Dummy System?</font>

1062
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,360
<font size="24">Dummy System functioning normally.</font>

1063

<font size="24">Control limiters being released.</font>

1064
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,180
<font size="24">What is this, Dad?</font>

1065
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,890
<font size="24">What is this?</font>

1066
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:09,310
<font size="24">What are you doing?!</font>

1067
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,180
<font size="24">Damn it!</font>

1068
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,270
<font size="24">Stop!</font>

1069
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:16,260
<font size="24">Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop...</font>

stop stop, stop, stop!</font>

1071
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:26,120
<font size="24">What's that sound?</font>

1072
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,520
<font size="24">Don't do it!</font>

1073
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:37,130
<font size="24">No!</font>

1074
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:58,980

<font size="24">Incinerate all surveillance

<font size="24">Kaji?</font>

1081
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,130
<font size="24">You were lucky, Katsuragi.</font>

1082
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,540
<font size="24">What about Ritsuko?</font>

1083
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:24,260
<font size="24">No worries. Her wounds
were more minor than yours.</font>

1084
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,130
<font size="24">I see.</font>

1085
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,510
<font size="24">Asuka! What about Eva Unit-03?</font>

1086
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,890
<font size="24">It was apparently disposed of...
as an Angel.</font>

1087
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:34,930
<font size="24">By Unit-01.</font>

1088
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,160
<font size="24">Unit-01's synchronization
circuits have been cut.</font>

1089
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,570
<font size="24">What about the ejection signal?</font>

1090
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,740
<font size="24">It has been locked out
from inside the plug.</font>

1091
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:53,200
<font size="24">He's literally locked himself in there.</font>

1092
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,580
<font size="24">Don't do this, Shinji!</font>

1093
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:57,120
<font size="24">Think about what you're doing!</font>

1094
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:01,040
<font size="24">Don't make me even angrier
by saying things like that.</font>

1095
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:04,090
<font size="24">Unit-01 has 285 seconds left.</font>

1096
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,970
<font size="24">With that much time, I can
destroy at least half of headquarters.</font>

1097
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:09,180
<font size="24">In his current state,
he might very well do it.</font>

1098
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,510
<font size="24">Shinji, please listen to us!</font>

1099
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,890
<font size="24">You may have been killed if
Commander Ikari hadn't made his decision!</font>

1100
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,390
<font size="24">That doesn't matter.</font>

1101
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,310
<font size="24">But it's the truth!</font>

1102
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,360
<font size="24">I told you, that doesn't matter!</font>

1103
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,400
<font size="24">Dad tried...
That bastard tried to kill Asuka!</font>

1104
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:29,610
<font size="24">Using me!</font>

1105
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,490
<font size="24">Why?!</font>

1106
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:34,580
<font size="24">Why?! Why did you do it?!</font>

1107
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,250
<font size="24">You don't understand at all, Dad!</font>

1108
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:39,790
<font size="24">I was a fool for trusting you!</font>

1109
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:42,920
<font size="24">You should lose someone
you care about, too, Dad!</font>

1110
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,590
<font size="24">Then, you'd understand!</font>

1111
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:47,439
<font size="24">Raise the LCL compression
density right up to the limit.</font>

1112
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,130
<font size="24">What?!</font>

1113
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:52,010
<font size="24">We have no time to put
up with a child's tantrum.</font>

1114
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,850
<font size="24">I still have the direct control circuits...</font>

1115
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,600
<font size="24">Damn it all!</font>

1116
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,940
<font size="24">Damn it all...</font>

1117
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:24,420
<font size="24">Ikari, you're always
listening to that, aren't you?</font>

1118
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:28,550
<font size="24">Yeah. It's something Dad used to use.</font>

1119
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,670
<font size="24">Just like your glasses, Ayanami.</font>

1120
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,510
<font size="24">But he didn't need it anymore,
so he left it behind.</font>

1121
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,010
<font size="24">Just like me.</font>

1122
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,890
<font size="24">It was at my teacher's place, so I took it.</font>

1123
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,060
<font size="24">When I close up my ears,
I can close up my heart.</font>

1124
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,610
<font size="24">That way, I don't have to deal
with the nasty world out there.</font>

1125
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,320
<font size="24">Nasty world?</font>

1126
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,820
<font size="24">That's right.</font>

1127
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,490
<font size="24">The world where the father I hate lives.</font>

1128
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,860
<font size="24">The world where the scary
Angels and Evas exist.</font>

1129
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:55,120
<font size="24">The world where
I'm forced to do painful things.</font>

1130
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,120
<font size="24">The world where Dad doesn't need
me as long as he has the Dummy.</font>

1131
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,910
<font size="24">The world where my friends get hurt.</font>

1132
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,960
<font size="24">Even so, good things happened, too.</font>

1133
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,630
<font size="24">But in the end, it all gets destroyed.</font>

1134
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,960
<font size="24">It's a nasty world.</font>

1135
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,470
<font size="24">I'm going to turn my back on it now.</font>

1136
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:16,140
<font size="24">I thought that if I did this,
Dad would protect me from the nasty world.</font>

1137
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:19,220
<font size="24">I'd tricked myself into believing that.</font>

1138
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:22,390
<font size="24">Did you try to understand
your father, Ikari?</font>

1139
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,230
<font size="24">I did.</font>

1140
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:26,860
<font size="24">Are you sure you didn't just do nothing?</font>

1141
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,190
<font size="24">I did try to understand him!</font>

1142
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,360
<font size="24">My dad's the one in the wrong!
He's the one who abandoned me!</font>

1143
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:37,950
<font size="24">And so, you're running away
from the things you don't like again.</font>

1144
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,620
<font size="24">So what?!</font>

1145
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:43,460
<font size="24">What's wrong with running
away from the things I don't like?!</font>

1146
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:48,540
<font size="24">This place again.</font>

1147
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:52,380
<font size="24">I'm sick of this.</font>

1148
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:59,640
<font size="24">Verify all instructions on
recovering fragments of Unit-03</font>

of any trace of the invasion,</font>

1151
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:16,990

psychologically contaminated by the Angel.</font>

<font size="24">We have no choice but
to keep her under quarantine.</font>

1153
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,450
<font size="24">They wouldn't possibly
do away with her, right?</font>

1154
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,450
<font size="24">She's a valuable sample specimen.</font>

1155
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,500
<font size="24">They would never.</font>

1156
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,790
<font size="24">Come out, Shinji Ikari.</font>

1157
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,170
<font size="24">Commander Ikari will see you now.</font>

1158
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,970
<font size="24">Insubordination. Seizing an
Eva for your own personal use.</font>

1159
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:43,140
<font size="24">Making crude threats.
These are all criminal acts.</font>

1160
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,930
<font size="24">Do you have anything to say for yourself?</font>

1161
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,390
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

1162
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,940
<font size="24">I do not want to pilot the Eva anymore.</font>

1163
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:53,780
<font size="24">I see. Then leave.</font>

1164
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:58,200
<font size="24">Running away again?</font>

1165
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,870
<font size="24">Your dreams are something you
have to sacrifice everything for</font>

1166
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,540
<font size="24">and attain for yourself.</font>

1167
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,540
<font size="24">No one will do it for you.</font>

1168
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,960
<font size="24">Grow up, Shinji.</font>

1169
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:17,260
<font size="24">I don't know what it's supposed
to mean to be a grownup.</font>

1170
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:27,520
<font size="24">It's me. Strike the Third
Boy from the records.</font>

1171
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,400
<font size="24">From now on, the primary operator
of Unit-01 will be the Dummy System.</font>

1172
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,690
<font size="24">No backup will be necessary.</font>

1173
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:38,150
<font size="24">I guess Rei didn't stop
Shinji from leaving.</font>

1174
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,620
<font size="24">I was hoping she'd do something,
since she'd shown signs of changing lately.</font>

1175
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,530
<font size="24">The relationships between
those kids is unfathomable.</font>

1176
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,750
<font size="24">But now, we're back down
to one pilot again.</font>

1177
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,870
<font size="24">Back to square one.</font>

1178
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,380
<font size="24">I'm sure you know this,</font>

1179
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:01,720
<font size="24">but even though you've been
stricken from Nerv's records,</font>

1180
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,470
<font size="24">you'll still be under surveillance</font>

1181
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:07,470
<font size="24">and your actions will be
restricted pretty heavily.</font>

1182
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,140
<font size="24">You forgot this.</font>

1183
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:12,400
<font size="24">Suzuhara and Aida
left you a lot of messages.</font>

1184
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,060
<font size="24">They're worried about you.</font>

1185
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:18,030
<font size="24">I don't really want it.
It's something I left behind.</font>

1186
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:20,990
<font size="24">You haven't asked after
Rei or Asuka, either.</font>

1187
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:30,040
<font size="24">The truth is, maybe I don't care
about humanity or the world, either.</font>

1188
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:34,040
<font size="24">Ultimately, I've ended
up in my current position,</font>

1189
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:38,550
<font size="24">but at first, I just wanted to get
a little closer to my late father.</font>

1190
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:41,300
<font size="24">And that's why I signed up with Nerv.</font>

1191
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,800
<font size="24">Just like how you piloted the Eva</font>

1192
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:47,060
<font size="24">because you wanted
Commander Ikari to need you.</font>

1193
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:52,270
<font size="24">Which is why I found myself
living vicariously through you.</font>

1194
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:55,860
<font size="24">And I know that you felt burdened by it.</font>

1195
01:23:55,940 --> 01:24:00,190
<font size="24">I also know that you've become disillusioned
with your purpose in piloting the Eva.</font>

1196
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,820
<font size="24">But even so, I want you to...</font>

1197
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,330
<font size="24">That day...</font>

1198
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,790
<font size="24">Rei had invited Commander Ikari, too.</font>

1199
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,960
<font size="24">She wanted you to become
closer with your father.</font>

1200
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,380
<font size="24">She wanted you two to laugh together.</font>

1201
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:27,510
<font size="24">I'll never be able to
laugh with anyone again.</font>

1202
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:35,980
<font size="24">The next stop is Kamigora. Kamigora.</font>

1203
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,020
<font size="24">The exits will be to your left.</font>

1204
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,110
<font size="24">The Japanese government has
declared a state of emergency.</font>

1205
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,160
<font size="24">In accordance with the
emergency regulations,</font>

1206
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:50,370
<font size="24">this train will stop at the
nearest evacuation station.</font>

1207
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:53,960
<font size="24">After disembarking, please head
straight for your designated platform</font>

1208
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,460
<font size="24">and board the evacuation incline.</font>

1209
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,290
<font size="24">It's an Angel.</font>

1210
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,960
<font size="24">Eva Unit-02 containment
measures have been unlocked.</font>

1211
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,050
<font size="24">Final safety systems have been disabled.</font>

1212
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,930
<font size="24">Core unit automatic
reconfiguration sequence has begun.</font>

1213
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:07,930
<font size="24">Man, it's cold!</font>

1214
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:10,600
<font size="24">There we go.</font>

1215
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,390
<font size="24">That's the new model for you!</font>

1216
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,940
<font size="24">It even fits me perfectly
in the chest. Feels so good!</font>

1217
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:24,360
<font size="24">The time has come.</font>

1218
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:26,740
<font size="24">All personnel, Battle
Stations, Condition One.</font>

1219
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,740
<font size="24">Prepare to intercept ground-to-air.</font>

1220
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:31,120
<font size="24">Target's status?</font>

1221
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,750
<font size="24">It has breached the
Old Odawara defensive line.</font>

1222
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,150
<font size="24">This is no laughing matter if the shockwave
can be felt all the way down here.</font>

1223
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:02,610
<font size="24">Direct hit on District 4. Damages unknown.</font>

1224
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,530
<font size="24">Surface and all armor
systems have been liquefied!</font>

1225
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:07,360
<font size="24">All 24 layers of specialized
armor with one strike?!</font>

1226
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:11,160
<font size="24">The 10th Angel.
The most powerful rejection type...</font>

1227
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:14,120
<font size="24">Its destructive power is
greater than we'd imagined.</font>

1228
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,700
<font size="24">This is all-out war!</font>

1229
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:18,670
<font size="24">Put all the fortified city's intercept
equipment to specialized use!</font>

1230
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,170
<font size="24">Hold it at bay, even
if it's just for a little while!</font>

1231
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,420
<font size="24">Eva Unit-02?! Who's piloting it?!</font>

1232
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:30,090
<font size="24">Unknown! We did not order its launch!</font>

1233
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,690
<font size="24">Target still active.</font>

1234
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:46,230
<font size="24">Second wave of attack had no effect.</font>

1235
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,780
<font size="24">I don't care! Evacuating
the residents gets top priority!</font>

1236
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,070
<font size="24">Authorizing third wave of guided N2
missiles! Send them in as direct support!</font>

1237
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,330
<font size="24">If we send the Eva to the surface
to intercept, it'll be too late.</font>

1238
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:56,870
<font size="24">Request Euro's cooperation.
Deploy Unit-02 to the Geofront.</font>

1239
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:57,580
<font size="24">How's Unit-00?</font>

1240
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:00,370
<font size="24">Making emergency repairs to the left arm.
It'll be just good enough to launch.</font>

1241
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,750
<font size="24">Send it to back up Unit-02
as soon as it's done.</font>

1242
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,479
<font size="24">Going out there alone will be dangerous.</font>

1243
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:04,960
<font size="24">Roger!</font>

1244
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:05,960
<font size="24">And Unit-01?</font>

1245
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,340
<font size="24">Currently preparing to
activate with the Dummy System.</font>

1246
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:10,300
<font size="24">Hurry it up!</font>

1247
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:15,970
<font size="24">That's in the direction of the city, right?</font>

1248
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,720
<font size="24">It'll be fine. We're headed
straight for the Geofront shelter.</font>

1249
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,600
<font size="24">Phone's aren't working, either!</font>

1250
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,150
<font size="24">Target entering the Geofront!</font>

1251
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,490
<font size="24">About to make contact with Eva Unit-02!</font>

1252
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:30,990
<font size="24">Do we have communications with Unit-02?</font>

1253
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:34,280
<font size="24">The two-way link has been cut.
Making contact from our end is...</font>

1254
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:36,450
<font size="24">I see.</font>

1255
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,910
<font size="24">So you want to do this alone.</font>

1256
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:47,340
<font size="24">It smells so good.</font>

1257
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:51,090
<font size="24">An Eva that smells like
someone else isn't bad, either.</font>

1258
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:53,720
<font size="24">It's already breached the
fifth line of defense.</font>

1259
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,890
<font size="24">If I don't get this wrapped
up quick, HQ is a goner!</font>

1260
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,160
<font size="24">Its AT field's too strong.</font>

1261
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,950
<font size="24">I won't get anywhere from this distance.</font>

1262
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,330
<font size="24">Hup.</font>

1263
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,450
<font size="24">Ho.</font>

1264
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:22,750
<font size="24">Hah!</font>

1265
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:26,840
<font size="24">Guess I'll make a go of it with this.</font>

1266
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:33,020
<font size="24">Let's see how you like this!</font>

1267
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:40,140
<font size="24">If I get it from point-blank range...</font>

1268
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:58,620
<font size="24">Oh, crap!</font>

1269
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:08,420
<font size="24">Why you little...! Talk about a toughie!</font>

1270
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,500
<font size="24">Dummy System connected.</font>

1271
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:11,880
<font size="24">Initiate contact.</font>

1272
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,260
<font size="24">Yes, ma'am.</font>

1273
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,130
<font size="24">What happened?</font>

1274
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:19,720
<font size="24">It's no use! Unit-01 won't activate!</font>

1275
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:23,640
<font size="24">It's refusing to accept the Dummy?</font>

1276
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,440
<font size="24">Fuyutsuki.</font>

1277
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,560
<font size="24">Take care of things for a while.</font>

1278
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:30,400
<font size="24">Up we go.</font>

1279
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,610
<font size="24">I won't be able to win at this rate.</font>

1280
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:36,240
<font size="24">All right! Guess I'll give it a try.</font>

1281
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:40,280
<font size="24">I'm going to see what an Eva can
do when it abandons its humanity.</font>

1282
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:41,620
<font size="24">Invert mode.</font>

1283
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:45,000
<font size="24">Backdoor code... "The Beast!"</font>

1284
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,090
<font size="24">Bear with it, Eva Unit-02.</font>

1285
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:02,220
<font size="24">I'll bear with it, too.</font>

1286
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,480
<font size="24">I had no idea an Eva
had such functionality!</font>

1287
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:11,310
<font size="24">The restrictors are being disengaged! All
readings are outside the standard range!</font>

1288
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,579
<font size="24">Unable to monitor plug interior! But...</font>

1289
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,530
<font size="24">Plug depth is likely in the negative range.</font>

1290
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,200
<font size="24">To think she's even willing
to plunge into the contamination zone...</font>

1291
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,740
<font size="24">We can't allow this! It's too dangerous!</font>

1292
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:26,000
<font size="24">Nothing ventured,</font>

1293
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,210
<font size="24">nothing...</font>

1294
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,210
<font size="24">gained!</font>

1295
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:53,770
<font size="24">Just a little more!</font>

1296
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,560
<font size="24">The Eva's bestial second form.</font>

1297
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,310
<font size="24">Even when it abandoned its humanity and
focused solely on combat, it couldn't win.</font>

1298
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:33,400
<font size="24">So this is the limit of our capabilities.</font>

1299
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,060
<font size="24">Unit-00?!</font>

1300
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:37,110
<font size="24">She doesn't even have a rifle!</font>

1301
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,860
<font size="24">Don't tell me...!</font>

1302
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:43,490
<font size="24">Rei, don't! Rei!</font>

1303
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,290
<font size="24">AT field at maximum!</font>

1304
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,920
<font size="24">I'll make it so Ikari...</font>

1305
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,760
<font size="24">never has to pilot the Eva again!</font>

1306
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,630
<font size="24">So, I'll...</font>

1307
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:16,110
<font size="24">A single Eva won't be able
to get through that AT field.</font>

1308
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:27,370
<font size="24">Unit-02, this is your final task!</font>

1309
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:32,210
<font size="24">Just one more layer!</font>

1310
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,050
<font size="24">Run, Unit-02 pilot.</font>

1311
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,680
<font size="24">Thank you.</font>

1312
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:57,730
<font size="24">Where's Unit-00?</font>

1313
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:15,620
<font size="24">This shelter has been
designated as being in an unsafe area.</font>

1314
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:18,710
<font size="24">Please evacuate to a safe area at once.</font>

1315
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:21,050
<font size="24">I repeat. This shelter...</font>

1316
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:32,220
<font size="24">Ow, that hurt...</font>

1317
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:35,310
<font size="24">I almost wound up dead there.</font>

1318
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:36,480
<font size="24">Oh?</font>

1319
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,900
<font size="24">What are you doing here?</font>

1320
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:44,110
<font size="24">I was wondering where
the other unit was. Now I know.</font>

1321
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:46,070
<font size="24">I...</font>

1322
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,120
<font size="24">I made up my mind not to pilot it anymore.</font>

1323
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,410
<font size="24">Questioning whether to pilot an Eva or not?</font>

1324
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,460
<font size="24">I had no idea anyone ever
agonized over something like that.</font>

1325
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:00,040
<font size="24">Then you should just get
out of here already.</font>

1326
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:03,000
<font size="24">Here, I'll help you.</font>

1327
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,010
<font size="24">I made up my mind not to pilot it.</font>

1328
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:10,890
<font size="24">I made up my mind not to pilot it.
I made up my mind not to pilot it.</font>

1329
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:12,720
<font size="24">But you know...</font>

1330
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:18,020
<font size="24">There's no fun in being all
twisted and sorry for yourself.</font>

1331
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:04,650
<font size="24">This can't be! An Angel devouring an Eva?</font>

1332
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:05,950
<font size="24">That's impossible!</font>

1333
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,980
<font size="24">Something's strange.</font>

1334
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:10,320
<font size="24">The target's ID signal is
switching over to that of Unit-00!</font>

1335
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:11,320
<font size="24">We've been had!</font>

1336
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:14,490
<font size="24">The Dogma won't self-destruct now,
even if the Angel enters!</font>

1337
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:17,120
<font size="24">It'll be able to get to Lilith with ease.</font>

1338
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:20,370
<font size="24">It's merging with Unit-00.</font>

1339
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:24,090
<font size="24">It assimilated the Eva, pilot and all.</font>

1340
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:26,710
<font size="24">You're going to end up dead, too.</font>

1341
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,130
<font size="24">Hurry up and run.</font>

1342
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,020
<font size="24">Aw, there he goes...</font>

1343
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:07,920
<font size="24">Above-ground HQ facilities annihilated!</font>

1344
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:09,130
<font size="24">Foundation 3 has suffered a direct hit!</font>

1345
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,630
<font size="24">Final armor plating has been liquefied!</font>

1346
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:13,890
<font size="24">No! The main shaft is completely exposed!</font>

1347
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:16,050
<font size="24">Is Unit-01 still not ready?</font>

1348
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,680
<font size="24">Unable to anchor plug in place!</font>

1349

1350
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:26,810
<font size="24">Keep going. Start over again from 308.</font>

1351
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,939
<font size="24">List 308, begin checking.</font>

1352
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,320
<font size="24">Why?</font>

1353
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,700
<font size="24">Why do you reject me, Yui?</font>

1354
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,700
<font size="24">Please let me pilot it!</font>

1355
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:38,620
<font size="24">Let me... Let me...</font>

1356
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,950
<font size="24">pilot Unit-01!</font>

1357
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,420
<font size="24">What are you doing here?</font>

1358
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:50,920
<font size="24">Dad!</font>

1359
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:52,220
<font size="24">I am...</font>

1360
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,630
<font size="24">the Evangelion Unit-01 pilot,</font>

1361
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,180

Terminal Dogma, Layer 7!</font>

1364
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,020
<font size="24">It's coming here!</font>

1365
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:07,650
<font size="24">Evacuate noncombatants!</font>

1366

1367
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:12,530
<font size="24">I repeat. Emergency evacuation
of noncombatants! Hurry!</font>

1368
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,830

<font size="24">Miss Misato!</font>

1371
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:53,110
<font size="24">Disengage all locks!</font>

1372
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:21,850
<font size="24">I'm out of power?</font>

1373
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:25,390
<font size="24">Unit-01 has reached its operational limit!
The auxiliary is down, too!</font>

1374
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,490
<font size="24">Shinji!</font>

1375
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:43,960
<font size="24">Shinji!</font>

1376
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:52,040
<font size="24">Give back...</font>

1377
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:53,960
<font size="24">Ayanami!</font>

1378
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:58,840
<font size="24">It's moving...?</font>

1379
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:01,470
<font size="24">But it's supposed to be
at its operational limit...</font>

1380
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:04,029
<font size="24">Has it gone berserk?</font>

1381
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:05,470
<font size="24">I don't know...</font>

1382
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:09,190
<font size="24">what in the world is
happening to Unit-01.</font>

1383
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:56,940
<font size="24">The Eva has powers like that?</font>

1384
01:39:57,030 --> 01:40:00,530
<font size="24">Unit-01 is transcending
the limits of humanity?</font>

1385
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:02,860
<font size="24">Plug depth is over 180!</font>

1386
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:04,320
<font size="24">He's already in danger!</font>

1387
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,990
<font size="24">Stop this, Shinji!</font>

1388
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,490
<font size="24">You won't be able
to come back to humanity!</font>

1389
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:11,080
<font size="24">I don't care what happens to me.</font>

1390
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,170
<font size="24">I don't care what happens to the world.</font>

1391
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,920
<font size="24">But Ayanami...</font>

1392
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,340
<font size="24">If it's the last thing I do,</font>

1393
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,550
<font size="24">I'm saving Ayanami, no matter what!</font>

1394
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,810
<font size="24">Go, Shinji!</font>

1395
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,440
<font size="24">Misato?!</font>

1396
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,110
<font size="24">Don't do it for someone else!</font>

1397
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:43,740
<font size="24">Do it for the sake of
what you want yourself!</font>

1398
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:56,000
<font size="24">Where are you, Ayanami?!</font>

1399
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,840
<font size="24">It's no use.</font>

1400
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:02,170
<font size="24">I can only survive in here now.</font>

1401
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:03,420
<font size="24">Ayanami?!</font>

1402
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:05,590
<font size="24">It's okay, Ikari.</font>

1403
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:08,140
<font size="24">Even if I disappear,
there are replacements.</font>

1404
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:09,430
<font size="24">There are replacements.</font>

1405
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:13,060
<font size="24">You're wrong!
You're the only Ayanami there is!</font>

1406
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:15,850
<font size="24">So I'm going to save you now!</font>

1407
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:34,460
<font size="24">Oh no!</font>

1408
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:37,790
<font size="24">The restrictors regulating
its shape are gone!</font>

1409
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,290
<font size="24">Unable to analyze!</font>

1410
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,840
<font size="24">The Eva we had contained
with the bounds of humanity</font>

1411
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:44,410
<font size="24">is reclaiming its rightful shape.</font>

1412
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,930
<font size="24">Breaking free of humanity's spell,</font>

1413
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:51,220
<font size="24">it's transcending humanity,
turning into a nearly divine being.</font>

1414
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:58,079
<font size="24">Inside the huge swells of complementarity,
it's binding together the heavens, the earth,</font>

1415
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,820
<font size="24">and all creation, transforming
into an energy condensate.</font>

1416
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:04,820
<font size="24">Purely to grant the wish of a human being.</font>

1417
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:06,710
<font size="24">For that and nothing else.</font>

1418
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:37,130
<font size="24">Ayanami!</font>

1419
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:56,420
<font size="24">Ayanami!</font>

1420
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:18,470
<font size="24">Ayanami!</font>

1421
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,070
<font size="24">Come on!</font>

1422
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:04,080
<font size="24">They forced Unit-01 to become the catalyst
before they had their pieces in place.</font>

1423
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,980
<font size="24">Commander Ikari,
Seele isn't going to take this lying down.</font>

1424
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:09,190
<font size="24">I want to spread my wings
in this big open sky</font>

1425
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:13,360
<font size="24">Just as we had thought, between those two,
they were able to awaken Unit-01.</font>

1426
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:14,450
<font size="24">Yes.</font>

1427
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:19,290
<font size="24">We have just a little more
to go until we attain our plan.</font>

1428
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:28,290
<font size="24">Ayanami, thank you for
the thing with my dad.</font>

1429
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:32,020
<font size="24">I'm sorry, I wasn't able to do anything.</font>

1430
01:44:32,590 --> 01:44:36,010
<font size="24">It doesn't matter now.</font>

1431
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:37,590
<font size="24">This is enough.</font>

1432
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:50,070
<font size="24">Now I see... He gets all the breaks.</font>

1433
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:53,810
<font size="24">I wonder if it's the
difference in smell, after all.</font>

1434
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:31,060
<font size="24">This is the birth of a new life form
that's grown beyond this world's Logos.</font>

1435
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:36,480
<font size="24">And as the price for that...
all life forms of old shall perish.</font>

1436
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:42,740
<font size="24">Wings...</font>

1437
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:45,430
<font size="24">Just like the ones 15 years ago...</font>

1438
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:50,130
<font size="24">Yes, the continuation
of the Second Impact...</font>

1439
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:52,400
<font size="24">The Third Impact is beginning!</font>

1440
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,260
<font size="24">The world is ending.</font>

1441
01:51:16,410 --> 01:51:17,780
<font size="24">What in the world was that?!</font>

1442
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:27,090
<font size="24">Now, the promised time
has come, Shinji Ikari.</font>

1443
01:51:27,170 --> 01:51:29,800
