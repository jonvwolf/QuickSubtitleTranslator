1
00:00:02,593 --> 00:00:05,289
"I'll say yon grey
is not the morning's eye

2
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:08,126
"'tis but the pale
reflect of Cynthia's brow

3
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:10,291
"nor that is not the lark

4
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,301
"whose notes do beat

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:15,133
"the vaulty heavens
so high above our heads.

6
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:18,106
"I have more care to stay
than will to go.

7
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:20,575
Come, Death. And welcome."

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,639
Yes! He nailed it!

9
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:31,177
Malcolm, that was wonderful!

10
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,782
So sensitive
and full of passion.

11
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,520
It was just beautiful.

12
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:42,062
Before you say anything

13
00:00:42,132 --> 00:00:43,997
just remember
we're best friends.

14
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,227
So that wheelchair

15
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:47,668
isn't going to stop
me from kicking your ass.

16
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:51,174
Bring it on, Homeo.

17
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:54,677
* Yes, no, maybe *

18
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,213
* I don't know *

19
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:00,546
* Can you repeat the question? *

20
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:02,812
* You're not the boss of me now *

21
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,218
* You're not the boss of me now *

22
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:07,587
* You're not the boss of me now *

23
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:09,649
* And you're not so big *

24
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:12,160
* You're not the boss of me now *

25
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:14,163
* You're not the boss of me now *

26
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,665
* You're not the boss of me now *

27
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,463
* And you're not so big *

28
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:24,098
* Life is unfair. **

29
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:27,166
Lois: What do you mean
what happens when you die?

30
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:28,768
You're dead.

31
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,369
That's it.

32
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:32,745
Now, honey,
that's not quite true.

33
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,147
Actually, son, after death

34
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:37,084
your body undergoes
a fascinating series of changes.

35
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:39,179
First it bloats up like a balloon

36
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,019
then shrivels like a raisin.

37
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,820
Then tiny microbes

38
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,453
you can't even see,
but are on you right now

39
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,087
start to devour your flesh

40
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:50,327
and return all the elements
in your body back to the soil.

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,368
Now, some people will tell you

42
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:56,099
that your hair keeps growing,
but that's... that's a myth.

43
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:58,368
It's actually
your head that shrinks.

44
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:01,172
Now go get ready
for Aunt Helen's funeral.

45
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:07,010
Julie, listen, I'm sorry
I'm canceling out so late.

46
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:08,346
That's okay.

47
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:10,079
I mean, it's a funeral.

48
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:12,212
So, were you close with your aunt?

49
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,779
No, but I guess my mom was.

50
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:16,052
She keeps saying
how important this is.

51
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:17,616
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

52
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:20,026
Especially since you're stuck
with the extra ticket.

53
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,029
Well, that's okay.

54
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:22,395
Maybe I'll askJimmy to go.

55
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,558
Who's Jimmy?

56
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:25,261
Jimmy Westcott.
He plays football.

57
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,360
Bye.

58
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:31,305
Oh, yeah. Life's fair.

59
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,036
Did you call that girl?

60
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,806
Yes, I called her and told her
I couldn't go to the concert

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,473
and now she's probably
going to invite someone else.

62
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:41,574
Well, Malcolm, I'm sorry
that my mother's sister...

63
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,815
the woman who took care of me
every day after school...

64
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,617
had to die and inconvenience

65
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,850
your social life.

66
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:49,551
She does it on purpose.

67
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:53,494
I could have made up a million
different escape plans

68
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:56,623
but now my brain
is filled with mom guilt.

69
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:06,836
Who's this?

70
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,343
How should I know.

71
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:09,310
Hal?

72
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,813
Beats me.

73
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:13,474
Dewey...

74
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:17,286
is this a friend of yours?

75
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:18,013
Uh-huh.

76
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:18,782
Who is he?

77
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:19,719
I don't know.

78
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:24,084
What's your name, son?

79
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:27,525
(inaudible)

80
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:28,825
Did he say Greg?

81
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:30,833
I thought he said Craig.

82
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,425
His name is Egg.

83
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:34,129
Egg?

84
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:35,034
I named him.

85
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,697
Well, you can't keep him.

86
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,401
He needs to go home, okay?

87
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:40,568
Okay.

88
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:42,976
This stinks.

89
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:45,378
Whether it's a wedding,
funeral or court date

90
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,747
these family gatherings
are always the same.

91
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,759
I can't wait till I get zits.

92
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:58,795
At least then I can fight back.

93
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:00,295
Hal, you have to get ready.

94
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,957
Why are you still messing around
with those record albums?

95
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,524
I thought I was going
to spend today in the garage

96
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,001
listening to them
on my quadraphonic

97
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,560
but now that we're going
to the funeral

98
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,401
I have to reseal the shrink wrap.

99
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:11,406
Hal!

100
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:13,033
I have to get my speech ready.

101
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,975
Honey, you know
you don't have to talk

102
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,376
at every funeral we go to.

103
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:17,572
I wish that were true.

104
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,137
You see how people look to me

105
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:21,810
when they ask if somebody has
a few words to say?

106
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,750
They're not looking to you

107
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,878
they're looking at you.

108
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,513
To, at... what's the difference?

109
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,252
(phone ringing)

110
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:30,588
Hello.

111
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,150
Hey, Mom, I'm just warning you

112
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,663
someone claiming to be
the Commandant might call you.

113
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,096
It's this guy down the hall.

114
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,100
Play along and pretend
you believe him.

115
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:39,260
He's totally harmless.

116
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:40,769
I can't talk to you right now.

117
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:42,862
We're on our way
to Aunt Helen's funeral.

118
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:43,871
Aunt Helen died?

119
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,998
Well, I sure hope so.

120
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:46,633
We're going to her funeral.

121
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,075
Well, when did she die?

122
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,545
Mom, why didn't anybody tell me?

123
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:52,775
We didn't want to have
to worry you over nothing.

124
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:53,781
Nothing? She's dead.

125
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,112
How's Uncle Fred taking it?

126
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,016
I don't think he's thought
too much about it.

127
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,076
He died two months ago.

128
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:59,349
What?!

129
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:01,287
Francis, I'm sorry.
I really have to go.

130
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,326
Here, talk to your brother.

131
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,190
Mom? Hello?

132
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:06,661
All right, let's see it.

133
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:09,026
I can't breathe.

134
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,361
Fine.

135
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,559
You know the drill.

136
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:12,727
Upgrade.

137
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,412
See? Problem solved.

138
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,209
Hello?

139
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,249
Oh.

140
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:27,783
Okay, well, you can wear

141
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,411
one of the suits that
Uncle Fred left you.

142
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,251
Aw, Mom, a dead suit?

143
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:35,723
Cool. A dead suit.

144
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,628
Dewey, why don't you help

145
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:42,722
your little friend find his way out?

146
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:46,565
Dewey: I did.
He keeps coming back.

147
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:50,833
This thing's an open casket, right?

148
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:52,465
I think so. Why?

149
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:56,239
Because I'm going to stash
this with Aunt Helen.

150
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:57,302
What is that?

151
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,347
It's a Mighty Man.

152
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,780
Mom and Dad had it in their closet

153
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,782
for some reason.

154
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,443
It's Dewey's birthday next week.

155
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,543
This is his present.

156
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,144
Oh.

157
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:06,052
What'd you do to it?

158
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,111
I stomped on it.

159
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,248
Why would you do that?

160
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:11,687
Look, I don't know why
I do the things I do.

161
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,820
I just know I don't
want to get caught.

162
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:16,365
That's why Aunt Helen
is getting a new friend.

163
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,923
You're going to bury
that with her?

164
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:18,990
You are so dead.

165
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,468
Hey, I watch lawyer shows.

166
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,731
Mom will think I did it

167
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:23,773
but she can't prove it
without this.

168
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,171
It's in the Constitution...

169
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:27,472
No evidence, no conviction.

170
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:28,943
E pluribus unum.

171
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:36,017
(chuckling):
Oh, yeah.

172
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,053
Hi, honey.

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,849
I finally found my joke cards.

174
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:40,617
They were behind the water heater.

175
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,658
- Really?
- Hey, how's this?

176
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,660
"A priest, a rabbi
and Uncle Fred are..."

177
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:45,854
Aunt Helen.

178
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,487
"Are playing golf
with Saint Peter."

179
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:48,622
Hal, please.

180
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:49,960
Have you seen my pun file?

181
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,365
It's in a box marked
"laughter thoughts."

182
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:55,666
Laughter thoughts?

183
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:01,808
How did she die?

184
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,345
Cats ate her face.

185
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:04,710
Dewey, I think you're confused.

186
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,043
I'm asking about Aunt Helen.

187
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:07,674
Cats ate her face.

188
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,048
Put Mom or Dad on the phone.

189
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,917
Hello?

190
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:14,081
Dad, what happened to Aunt Helen?

191
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:17,058
Cats ate her face. Dewey
knows more about it than I do.

192
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:21,491
Mom, I hate wearing
Reese's hand-me-downs.

193
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:22,895
Look at this.

194
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:26,163
Jelly in the pockets,
the fly's broken

195
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:28,500
and it smells like wet dog.

196
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:31,199
Well, you should be glad
he only wore it once.

197
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:33,299
You know, I'm trying
to be there for Mom

198
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:36,140
but the annoyances are starting
to outweigh the guilt.

199
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm this close to sneaking
out of the whole thing.

200
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:41,679
Well, I suppose you're
entitled to complain.

201
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,948
After all,
it's only my Aunt Helen.

202
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,546
What is she, a mind reader?

203
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,717
And then there were
ants on her bones

204
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,953
and the police came.

205
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,289
Dad, listen...

206
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,626
can you think of anything
that rhymes with cadaver?

207
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:56,393
How long is this
funeral going to take?

208
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:57,956
Including traveling time?
All day.

209
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,126
(sighs)

210
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:00,100
I know, I know.

211
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,831
But it will
make your mom happy.

212
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:03,930
Mom really loved Aunt Helen, huh?

213
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:07,067
Oh, God, no.
Your mom hated her.

214
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:09,577
What? She hated her?

215
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,773
Everyone did.
Horrible woman.

216
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:13,281
I used to have
to forbid her from

217
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,443
calling here 'cause
she always made your mom cry.

218
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,850
I can't believe Mom
tricked me like that.

219
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,048
I'll tell you one thing...

220
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,182
I now consider myself totally free

221
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:23,691
to ditch this funeral.

222
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,990
I got to callJulie.

223
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:27,051
Hello?

224
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,256
Malcolm!

225
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:29,628
Thank God,
somebody I can talk to.

226
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,996
Sorry, I have to make a call.

227
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,830
(dial tone)

228
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:39,738
So, your aunt's... not dead?

229
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,834
No. It turned out to be
one of those comas

230
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:43,310
where they think you're dead

231
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,348
and they put you
on the embalmer's table

232
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:47,110
and you wake up
at the last second.

233
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:48,275
It was a close call.

234
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,443
Uh, okay.

235
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,180
I guess we'll pick you up at 2:00.

236
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,812
Great.

237
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,655
I figure I'll commit to it first
and come up with a plan later.

238
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:59,024
I always think better
under pressure...

239
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:01,256
or is it when
I'm not under pressure?

240
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,423
Oh, well.

241
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:04,433
Too late now.

242
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,490
I'm ready to go.

243
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:06,535
Yeah. Hey!

244
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,434
You're taking a backpack
to the funeral?

245
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,336
My back gets cold.

246
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:12,272
Fair enough.

247
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:13,604
Lois:
Look, Francis

248
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:14,870
I guess I get scattered.

249
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,571
You know, sometimes
I forget what I told you

250
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:17,977
and you're not here so...

251
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:20,175
I'm not there
because you sent me away.

252
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,185
I swear, I'm not even
a part of this family anymore.

253
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:25,551
Francis, it's very important
that you understand

254
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:26,714
that is not true

255
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,087
but I don't have time right now.

256
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:29,386
I understand.

257
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,825
It's not like it's a matter
of life and death.

258
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:33,192
Oh, wait, it is!

259
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,696
Anyone else die in the last

260
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,026
five minutes
I should know about?

261
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,033
You wanna know everything
that's been happening?

262
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,762
Your father mowed the lawn

263
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,428
Reese polished off all the cereal

264
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,631
and I dropped
a frying pan on my foot

265
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:45,469
and I got a big black toe.

266
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,976
You want me to send a picture?

267
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:49,875
Egg! Cut it out!

268
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,345
What is Egg?

269
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,245
Oh, he's a new boy in the house.

270
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:54,248
What?!

271
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,013
Okay, it'll only hurt
for a second

272
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:00,545
and I'll get out of the funeral.

273
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:02,386
I can tellJulie
a really cool story

274
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,586
about how I got my black eye.

275
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,028
Aw, I'm so gutless.

276
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,160
Why are you taking so long?
Let's go.

277
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:14,328
Reese, listen.

278
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:15,496
I know it sounds crazy

279
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,267
but I need you to hit me.

280
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,307
(groans)

281
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:19,966
You idiot!

282
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,271
In the eye!

283
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:22,936
And leave a mark for Mom to see?

284
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,309
Forget it.

285
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,678
No bruises, no evidence...

286
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:28,614
no crime.

287
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,114
I guess we move on
to plan "B:" lying.

288
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,282
What book report?

289
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,484
I just remembered.

290
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,493
I have a big book report
due tomorrow

291
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:40,586
and I haven't even
started reading it.

292
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:41,823
Standard technique...

293
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:43,365
You volunteer a small crime

294
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,924
to distract them
from looking for the big one.

295
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,333
So, what's the report on?

296
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:48,529
A Tale of Two Cities.

297
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,902
- Oh, how many words?
- 750.

298
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:52,203
Was that on your
assignment sheet?

299
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,709
- No, it's an addendum.
- When did you get that?

300
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:56,369
Thursday.
I didn't bring it home.

301
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:57,242
That's why I forgot
to do the assignment.

302
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:58,575
Ooh, nice one.

303
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:01,412
Well, I suppose
if it's school work...

304
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:02,610
That's the mislead.

305
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,209
Wait for the reverse.

306
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,084
A Tale of Two Cities.

307
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,487
Who's that by?

308
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:08,421
Charles Dickens.

309
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,391
Oh, I thought it was Victor Hugo.

310
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,427
No, it's Dickens.

311
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:12,756
Is that the one
with Jean Valjean?

312
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:13,989
That's Les Miserables.

313
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:15,428
No, no.

314
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:16,760
Isn't A Tale of Two Cities

315
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,494
the one with Jean Valjean,
where he's says

316
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:20,092
"It's a far, far
better thing I do..."

317
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,762
right before he steals
a loaf of bread?

318
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:24,432
No. Sidney Carton says that
right before they behead him.

319
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,441
I thought you hadn't read it.

320
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:27,703
What?

321
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:29,335
No. I said I hadn't written it.

322
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:30,310
And when is it due?

323
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,813
Tomorrow, I told you.

324
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:34,213
- On Les Miserables?
- Yes. No!

325
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:36,479
- A Tale of Two Cities.
- Which you haven't read.

326
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:38,748
- Right.
- But you just said you did.

327
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:41,984
No, l-I said I didn't,
and then you said...

328
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,492
it was Thursday, and...

329
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:47,428
Look, I just don't want to go
to this stupid funeral.

330
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,590
There's no reason for me to go

331
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,691
and I want to go
to the concert with Julie!

332
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,258
Let's go!
I'll be waiting in the car.

333
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:54,667
Malcolm

334
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,102
I am ashamed of you...

335
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:59,141
Wanting to deny
your poor Aunt Helen her due.

336
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,109
No, that won't work on me
because I know

337
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:03,202
you didn't love Aunt Helen.
You hated her!

338
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,474
'Course I did. What does that
have to do with anything?

339
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:06,446
What?

340
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:07,915
Malcolm,
this isn't about love.

341
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:09,076
It's about family.

342
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:10,449
We have a duty to this family

343
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,181
and we are darn well
going to do it.

344
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,347
But why?

345
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:14,856
It's not fair.

346
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:18,018
You can't just stick the word
"family" in front of something

347
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:19,857
and turn everyone
else into slaves.

348
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:21,021
It makes no sense.

349
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:22,325
No one liked this woman

350
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:24,457
so why do we have
to pretend like we did now?

351
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:25,899
What good will it do anybody?

352
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:28,301
Hal?

353
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:30,703
I got nothing.

354
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,536
I could really use
some support here.

355
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:33,701
Excuse me?

356
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,505
I am being
incredibly supportive.

357
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,012
I'm giving up my entire day
for this-this thing

358
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:39,844
and you don't hear me
complaining.

359
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,679
Hal, it was a bunch
of old record albums.

360
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:43,719
You're not giving up
something important.

361
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,583
Well, they're important to me.

362
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:46,986
You-You people.

363
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,318
I can't believe you.

364
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,120
I asked you to do
one thing that...

365
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,286
You're not asking:
You're ordering.

366
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,597
Lois:
After all I do

367
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:56,689
for this family.

368
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:58,631
I cook, I clean,
I spackle, I plunge

369
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:01,329
and none of it means anything
to any of you people

370
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,599
and the one time
I ask you for something...

371
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:06,506
something that I shouldn't even
have to ask you for...

372
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:09,909
and all I get are complaints!

373
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,537
Well, what about me, hmm?

374
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:14,708
You think I want to be
cleaning out the gutters

375
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:17,753
when I could be surfing
the beaches of Europe

376
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,947
or-or cruising around on my hog?

377
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,547
- What hog?
- Ah-ha!

378
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:22,556
Exactly.

379
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,717
Where's my hog?!

380
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:26,125
Where do you think you're going?

381
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:27,287
I have had it!

382
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,126
From now on,
no one has to do anything.

383
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:30,927
We could all just do
whatever we want

384
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,558
and I want to take

385
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,535
a bubble bath!

386
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,037
Fine!

387
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:42,569
So, that's a "yes"
on the concert?

388
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:50,082
Come on, come on.

389
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:54,580
(sighs)

390
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,454
Are you going to be
in there all day?

391
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:58,255
If I feel like it.

392
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,660
Fine. Just so you know,
when I'm done in the garage

393
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,665
I'm using the bathroom
whether you're in here or not.

394
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:09,269
Mom, I think we should go
to Aunt Helen's funeral.

395
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean,
she was a good woman.

396
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:12,564
It's the least we can do.

397
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:15,167
I don't know what you're trying
to pull, but I don't like it.

398
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,178
Am I the only one
that cared about her?

399
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:19,271
You're the good one.
Enjoy your moment in the sun.

400
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:20,873
Now, get out of here.

401
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,941
This is me time.

402
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,853
Hey, Reese,
which one stinks more?

403
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:30,182
What's your problem?

404
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,487
You couldn't keep your

405
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:33,188
big mouth shut
until after the funeral.

406
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:34,820
I'll have to wait
for another relative

407
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:36,330
to die to bury this thing.

408
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,366
It could be weeks.

409
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,593
You'll think of something.

410
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,067
No, I won't.

411
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:42,195
You have good ideas all the time

412
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:44,205
but for me, this was special.

413
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:46,764
Hey! You can't leave
this mess here.

414
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,174
I've got a guest coming over.

415
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:51,873
Too bad. Thanks to you, no one
has to do anything anymore.

416
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:53,347
It's anarchy, baby.

417
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,441
That's the word, right?

418
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:03,050
Um... Mom?

419
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:04,821
I was just wondering

420
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,725
if you could wash
this shirt for me?

421
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:08,423
(laughing)

422
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,329
You must be joking.

423
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,129
But you're the only one
that knows how to use

424
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,964
the washer and dryer
without getting shocked.

425
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,128
Please?

426
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:18,264
Well... since you said please.

427
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:24,679
There you go.

428
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,681
All washed.

429
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:33,044
I think you've been
in the garage long enough.

430
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,384
(chuckling)

431
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:36,220
Okay.

432
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,418
(electrical crackling)

433
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:39,552
Gosh!

434
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:41,153
Well, no, no, no.

435
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,063
You are going to get
your own outlet.

436
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:48,160
Uh... okay, here we go.

437
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:51,832
Okay... okay, here we are.

438
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,671
(laughing)

439
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,673
Come on.

440
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,381
Come on.

441
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,081
Gotcha!

442
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,719
Oh.

443
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,290
No, not my problem today.

444
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:14,454
(claps hands)

445
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,088
(chuckling)

446
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:23,536
(music playing loudly)

447
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:35,914
Hand me that loofah.

448
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:38,918
He wants juice.

449
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:40,421
Go get your own juice.

450
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,151
You said I'm not supposed to.

451
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:44,159
(sighing):
You're right.

452
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,819
Okay, from now on

453
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:48,295
you are officially old enough
to get your own juice.

454
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:49,729
Poof.

455
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,894
(music continues)

456
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,773
Darn it.

457
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:02,436
Darn it.

458
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:03,774
Darn it.

459
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:06,337
Mom, I spilled!

460
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,849
So? Clean it up.

461
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:20,491
Green apple soap.

462
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:23,464
Girls like green apples, right?

463
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,627
Oh, man,
she got my pants wet, too.

464
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:29,968
(music continues)

465
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,472
(loudly):
Hello?

466
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:36,641
Is Malcolm here?

467
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,145
(gasps)

468
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,647
Is Malcolm here?!

469
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:41,148
Huh?

470
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:42,445
Malcolm?!

471
00:17:58,768 --> 00:17:59,860
Julie:
Malcolm?

472
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,165
Julie!

473
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,733
Nothing.

474
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:15,648
(screaming)

475
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:19,387
Oh, my God!

476
00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:20,547
Are you okay?

477
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:22,056
I just wanted to be nice.

478
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:24,115
People told me not to come
to your house.

479
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:26,058
I thought they were
just being silly!

480
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:27,561
Julie, I'm sorry.

481
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,325
Things aren't usually like this.

482
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,889
Just give me a minute
and I'll be ready to go.

483
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,368
I don't want to go anymore!
Just leave me alone!

484
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:38,398
(music continues)

485
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:40,374
(music stops)

486
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,503
How could you let her see me
in my underwear?

487
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:47,476
Mom, this has gone too far.

488
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,211
You have to do something.

489
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:51,253
It's not supposed to be like this.

490
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,288
We're not supposed
to injure my friends.

491
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:56,052
We're not supposed to let people
see me in my underpants.

492
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,525
We're supposed to be there
for each other.

493
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,256
Like when a family member dies,
and we're supposed to go

494
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,763
to their funeral?

495
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,595
I'll be in my room.

496
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,439
Then she slid into the trash
and ran off.

497
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:21,381
I swear, this whole family
is falling apart.

498
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,748
Yes! I knew
this moment would come.

499
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,719
They don't have
their scapegoat around

500
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:27,449
so everything goes to hell.

501
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:30,048
No one realized that I'm the one
who held this family together.

502
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,718
Without me to blame everything on

503
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,955
they don't know what to do
with themselves.

504
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,292
A scapegoat... thanks.

505
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:36,626
Mom thinks...

506
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,132
He's right.

507
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,634
This family needs a scapegoat.

508
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:44,070
I started this, so I should be
the one to end it.

509
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:54,680
I did a terrible thing today.

510
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,650
I tore this family apart

511
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,482
and I'm really sorry for that

512
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:00,613
but...

513
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,023
it's not half as bad...
as what Reese did!

514
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:10,423
Oh, my God!

515
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:12,490
Was this Dewey's present?

516
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:13,865
Dewey:
Present?

517
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:14,994
Lois:
Reese, how could you?

518
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:17,164
Do you know how
expensive this was?

519
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:17,864
Hal?

520
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,668
I'm on it.

521
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,333
That was a terrible

522
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:22,001
thing to do
to your little brother.

523
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:23,773
He was going to bury it
with Aunt Helen.

524
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,713
You were going to make
Aunt Helen spend eternity

525
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:28,147
with a crushed Mighty Man?

526
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:29,878
M-Mighty Man?

527
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:31,214
I can't believe you.

528
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,948
This is a whole new low, Reese.

529
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,115
First of all,
this is all circumstantial.

530
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,853
I don't know how that thing
got in my backpack.

531
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,327
As for this Aunt Helen business,
no one knows what I would've

532
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:42,864
done at that funeral
because we're not going.

533
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:44,229
Who says we're not going?

534
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,392
You did.

535
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:46,958
Well, you can guess again.

536
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,833
You are going to march
right up to that coffin

537
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,496
and apologize
to that poor, dead woman.

538
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,234
We all are.

539
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:54,208
All right,
everyone in the car as is.

540
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:57,040
We'll have to drive creatively,
but we might make the end.

541
00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:58,876
Let's go. Chop, chop,
here we go!

542
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,719
Egg! Come on!

543
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,788
Aunt Helen used to say

544
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,762
(raspy-voiced): "Oh, you're going
to miss me when I'm gone."

545
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,424
And, uh, by the looks
of today's turnout

546
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,230
I could see it wasn't
just an idle threat.

547
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:22,770
(whispering): Yeah, Francis,
your father's giving a speech

548
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:24,396
and it's actually kind of good.

549
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:25,667
Can I get my phone back?

550
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:27,436
I'm almost done, sweetie.

551
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,501
Oh, Aunt Helen looks just lovely.

552
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:31,842
You turn right back around, mister!

553
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:34,508
You'll never guess what Reese did.

554
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,450
Well, it's been
a pretty productive day.

555
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,782
I madeJulie Rulerman hate me.

556
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,652
Reese is going to kill me
the second we get home

557
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:42,952
and right now

558
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,585
Aunt Helen is personally
bad-mouthing me to God.

559
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:48,528
You want some more water,
Uncle Louie?

560
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:51,031
Sure.

561
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,092
I need someone to put in
a good word for me.
